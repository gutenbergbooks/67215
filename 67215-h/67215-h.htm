<small>ENEMY OR FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Navy-Yard at Brooklyn buzzed with
its daily turmoil of labor. It was a bright
June morning, and the high chimneys of the
numerous shops and foundries belched forth
flame and smoke. Thousands of begrimed
workmen toiled incessantly, hammering,
bending and riveting masses of metal, fashioning
them into shape to be carried by the
steam cranes to be blended into the hulls of
waiting battle-ships.</p>

<p>Through this scene of activity two boys
walked briskly. Their clothing was new and
in the latest style. It clung to their well set
up figures, betraying the hand of the military
tailor. Each carried a bright leather suitcase
to the top of which a cased sword was
strapped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Emerging from the tangle of buildings, the
youths glanced about, and an exclamation of
pleasure escaped them as a view of their
nation&#8217;s sea power met their eyes: ten huge
battle-ships resplendent in their glassy white
and contrasting buff paint lay tied up, filling
every foot of the dock frontage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is ours, Phil?&#8221; asked one of the
youths, stopping and setting his case down
with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Philip Perry, as he slowly shifted his bag
to his other hand, glanced down the long line
of stately defenders.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is, Syd,&#8221; he finally replied,
pointing his free hand in the direction of one
moored at the foot of the street. &#8220;The one
with three smoke-stacks and eight turrets.
What a beauty she is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip Perry and Sydney Monroe were the
names stenciled in bold type on the new
traveling bags, and underneath the names in
smaller capitals were the letters: U. S. N.</p>

<p>Any one familiar with the navy could have
told by a glance that they were midshipmen,
just graduated from the Naval Academy at
Annapolis and in the distribution of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
class to the many ships of the navy, these
two had received orders and were on their
way to report for duty on board one of the
powerful battle-ships lying directly before
them.</p>

<p>The four years&#8217; course of study at Annapolis
had filled their minds with a store of wisdom,
and the rigorous outdoor drills had
given to their bodies suppleness and strength.
They were a sample of the finished output
of the Naval National Academy.</p>

<p>The picturesque life on the ocean would
give them ample opportunity to benefit themselves
and put to good use their stored-up
knowledge. They were on the threshold of a
new era, in which their character and professional
worth would be valued by the success
achieved.</p>

<p>As they walked in silence toward their
future home, their minds dwelt on the vast
intricacies of this creation of steel, but these
thoughts were quickly forgotten as they
stepped over the side of the U. S. S. &#8220;Connecticut&#8221;
and reported their arrival to the
officer of the deck.</p>

<p>They were wrapped in wonder at the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
of getting a battle-ship ready for sea. Ammunition
and stores were being taken on board
from huge cargo barges with lightning rapidity
by hundreds of strong bronzed sailormen.
All was activity. The dockyard had completed
its work on the steel hull and all
hands seemed eager to breathe once more the
pure air of the sea.</p>

<p>Five minutes later they were grasping the
welcoming hands of their future messmates&mdash;those
midshipmen who had been graduated
from Annapolis one short year ago, yet had
mastered the mystery of many things which
to the newcomers were as an unopened book.</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain will see you both as soon as
you are ready, sir,&#8221; the marine orderly reported
to Phil.</p>

<p>Donning their bright new uniforms, which
had been the sole contents of their valises,
and buckling on their swords, they were
ushered into the captain&#8217;s spacious quarters.</p>

<p>They found him brusque and businesslike.
A hand to each in turn, with a firm manly
pressure:</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to have you with us;&#8221; then to the
attentive orderly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;Show these gentlemen to the executive
officer,&#8221; and the ordeal was over.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney had no time for conversation
during the next twenty minutes, while
they found themselves hurried through the
rounds of official formality and then sent to
their quarters to unpack and be ready for immediate
duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;They gave me no choice of a roommate,
did they, Syd?&#8221; said Phil, ten minutes later,
as he dived into his trunk and commenced to
toss his belongings on to his bunk to have
them more handy to stow into the numerous
small receptacles located about the narrow
room which he and Sydney had been ordered
to occupy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they didn&#8217;t,&#8221; answered Sydney, with
a grin, &#8220;but we have stood each other for four
years; I guess we can do it for two more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last of their belongings was scarcely
stowed when a servant announced that the
midday meal was ready in the mess room.</p>

<p>They entered and were greeted by more of
their former schoolmates. Phil found his seat
next to Marshall, an old friend of Annapolis
days, who was anxious to give him all the tips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
possible on what he could expect in his daily
life on a battle-ship. Phil listened intently
while he breathlessly recited all the gems of
wisdom that came into his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in Lazar&#8217;s division. It&#8217;s a crackerjack,
too; you&#8217;ve got your work cut out for
you. He&#8217;s a hustler. He isn&#8217;t much liked by
the middies because he &#8216;horses&#8217; us so much,
but the captain swears by him. Beaty&mdash;you
remember old &#8216;Pike&#8217;?&mdash;he had your job, but
I guess Lazar was too many for him. We
sent him to the hospital with nerves a week
ago. Some of the fellows saw him yesterday,
doing the gentleman act there, looking as pink
and fresh as a girl. Hope you will manage
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil tried to look cheerful, but Marshall&#8217;s
quick eye detected something wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Lazar? of course you were
at the Academy with him, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and glanced hurriedly into Phil&#8217;s
face, then dropped his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it was you that fought him. How
unfortunate!&#8221; Then musingly, &#8220;He is not the
man to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that he would allow a boy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
quarrel&mdash;remember, that was nearly four years
ago&mdash;to influence his feelings for me now,&#8221;
answered Phil, gaining but scant comfort from
his own words.</p>

<p>He remembered how bitter Lazar had been
in his relations to him the few months before
the older man graduated and left him in
peace. He was but a plebe then. Well, the
future would tell.</p>

<p>As soon as the short meal was over Phil
went to his room and changed his uniform,
donning the oldest he owned, but the bright
lace and lustrous braid was in great contrast
to the uniforms of those officers and midshipmen
who had received their baptism of salt
spray, in the year at sea on board the battle-ship,
cruising and drilling until their ship
was considered to be in efficient condition to
join the fleet and compete in all the drills and
games that go to make up the very full itinerary
of the sailor&#8217;s life afloat.</p>

<p>Sydney came in full of enthusiasm, having
seen his divisional officer and obtained an idea
of what he had to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a fine job,&#8221; he cried, as he threw
his coat on his bunk and started to get out his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
older clothes. &#8220;Four seven-inch guns, all my
own; Lieutenant Brand says if I don&#8217;t make
all hits at target practice, he won&#8217;t give me a
two-five&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, stopping and catching sight of his
chum&#8217;s face in the mirror back of the washstand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever is wrong, Phil?&#8221; he exclaimed
anxiously. &#8220;You look as glum as an oyster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil hesitated. Should he confide in his
roommate of Annapolis days? Or should he
fight it out alone? He felt it was a situation
needing every ounce of his manhood and tact.
What harm could be done by asking Syd&#8217;s
friendly advice?</p>

<p>&#8220;I have great misgivings, Syd,&#8221; he commenced
cautiously. &#8220;I was prepared for almost
anything, but Lazar for my divisional
officer had never occurred to me. Do you
blame me for looking and feeling glum?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney&#8217;s joyous face became serious in an
instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s certainly hard luck. Why couldn&#8217;t
I have been assigned to his division instead
of you?&#8221; exclaimed he, generously. &#8220;I never
liked him, but he doesn&#8217;t know me from an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
old shoe, and he has a good reason to know
you.&#8221; Then, reminiscently, &#8220;I can remember
his face after your fight with him as
plainly as if it were yesterday; the referee
called it a draw, but every one knew that you
had the better of the fight. He was in the
hospital for a week until his face healed up,
while you were in ranks at the next
formation, with no more marks than I give
myself daily shaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe he has forgotten, or at
least forgiven?&#8221; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;You or I would have long ago,&#8221; replied
Sydney thoughtfully, &#8220;but Lazar always
seemed so vindictive to me; maybe his Latin
blood makes him so. Jules Lazar is not
an appropriate name for a forgiving nature;
it sounds very belligerent to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly are comforting,&#8221; smiled
Phil, as he started to leave the room to report
to his divisional officer and find out for himself
what the outward signs of friendship or
enmity might tell.</p>

<p>With many misgivings he went up the
companion ladder leading to the quarter-deck.
As his foot touched the clean white deck, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
raised his hand to his cap in salute to the
flag.</p>

<p>Standing near the great twelve-inch turret,
managing the labor of filling the
spacious storerooms and magazines, was
Lazar, the spy-glass in his gloved hand
identifying him as the officer of the deck, in
charge of the progress of work on the big
fighter.</p>

<p>Phil stepped smartly up to him and
saluted.</p>

<p>Lazar turned slowly toward him. His
brow contracted imperceptibly as he returned
the salute of the midshipman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry reports to you, sir, as junior
officer of the fourth division,&#8221; Phil said in
the official tone he had been taught to use at
Annapolis. His eyes unwaveringly sought
the restless energetic face of his divisional
officer.</p>

<p>Would Lazar give him his hand? Phil
was ready to believe that his boyish quarrel
and fight were forgiven. He waited what
seemed a long time while officer and midshipman
each looked straight into the eyes of the
other. Neither wavered, and each seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
wish to sweep aside the other&#8217;s mask and read
the thoughts behind the cold impassive exterior.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, Mr. Perry,&#8221; finally replied
Lazar. &#8220;Get a correct list of the division, and
a copy of our station bills. You will find
them posted in the division bulletin-board.&#8221;
Then glancing at the bright clean uniform of
the youth before him, &#8220;You had better put
on your oldest clothes, then come up here,
and I shall give you something to occupy
you. You stand watch with me, you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil held his hand at his side ready to
offer it at the first intimation that it would be
accepted by the older man, but Lazar did not
show by voice or sign that he wished for
anything more than purely official relations
with the midshipman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready now for duty, sir,&#8221; answered
Phil in a voice that, strive as he could to hide
it, betrayed a tone of disappointment, tinged
with indignation. Glancing down at his converted
Annapolis uniform, &#8220;I have no older
ones,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;I might as well break
this in, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;Very good; you will take charge of the
work on the forecastle.&#8221; Glancing about and
motioning a smart-looking petty officer to advance,
&#8220;O&#8217;Neil, here, is in our division.&#8221; Then
addressing the attentive coxswain, &#8220;You are
excused from other work and will lend Mr.
Perry a hand. He is our new midshipman,
and is about to direct the work on the forecastle.&#8221;
Then again turning to Phil and dropping
his voice: &#8220;That&#8217;s a splendid man, he knows
the name of every man on board. You will
find him a willing subordinate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saluted stiffly in Annapolis fashion,
while O&#8217;Neil jerked his hand toward his cap
and in a businesslike voice announced his
readiness by a hearty, &#8220;Aye, aye, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil led the way through the battery deck,
the men engaged in work there standing aside
in respectful attention to allow the new arrival
to pass.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s mind wavered between the decision
that Lazar would give him a fair showing, and
the contrary one that he would make his life
as unpleasant as possible; and from the accounts
he had heard of Beaty, the midshipman
in the hospital with &#8220;too much Lazar,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
as one of the midshipmen had diagnosed
his complaint, he knew his new divisional
officer, by voice and action, could make the
life of one he disliked so unhappy that a cot
in the hospital might be preferable.</p>

<p>He found his work on the forecastle just
what he needed to keep his mind off his troubles,
and in the language of O&#8217;Neil: &#8220;he
made good,&#8221; as he encouraged, directed and
helped the men handle the bulky packages.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fine young gentleman,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
confided to a brother petty officer, as he watched
Phil put his shoulder against a twelve-inch
shell and guide it clear of an iron hatch top.
&#8220;Do you see the way the boys are working?
As if they were to get shore leave at the end
of this job. It&#8217;s a pity to see him spoil them
bright new clothes, but when I tried to help
him he told me he wanted exercise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had found his thoughts very unpleasant
companions as he had watched the work
progress, and now doing the manual labor of
a leading man, he had forgotten, for the time
at least, the sombre reflections that had, like
spectres, come into his mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Would this man attempt to ruin him?
And could he do so if he so wished?</p>

<p>He considered going to the captain and asking
to be assigned to another division, stating
his reasons, but he saw immediately how
childish it would seem to that busy officer.
A boys&#8217; quarrel, long ago forgotten, he would
call it.</p>

<p>Phil wished it were so.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>UNDER ARREST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> awakened the next morning at an
early hour. Hurriedly dressing, he went on
deck.</p>

<p>His sleep had refreshed him and his mind
was less ready to dwell on the dark side of his
life on board ship. He believed when he and
Lazar had become better acquainted the old
grudge would be overshadowed in the intimacy
of the life on the ocean.</p>

<p>With muster-roll and station bills neatly
copied in his note-books, he was impatient for
the bugle to sound the call to &#8220;quarters,&#8221;
when he would meet his division for the first
time.</p>

<p>He watched with interest the scene about
him. Petty officers and men were busily engaged
putting the finishing touches to the
clean deck and bright brass work of the vessel.
Others were using a clothes-brush carefully
on their neatly fitting blue uniforms or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
giving a parting rub to their broad shoes.
The gunners&#8217; mates guarded their huge guns
jealously, occasionally rubbing an imaginary
spot of rust or dirt.</p>

<p>While the bugle call was being sounded on
each of the many decks, he was an interested
spectator of the magic effect of the clear notes.
Confusion seemed to melt away into the most
perfect order as men took their places in ranks
abreast the guns they served.</p>

<p>Lazar stood facing his division,&mdash;fifty well
set up, youthful men. Back of him were the
turret guns for which his division formed the
crews. Across the deck the marine guard was
paraded, the military bearing of the soldier-sailors
contrasting with the easy pose of the
picturesque sailormen about them.</p>

<p>The executive officer was at his station
across the deck from Lazar.</p>

<p>Such is the formation for quarters on
board a war-ship of the navy. Each divisional
officer musters his men, inspecting carefully,
in order that the standard of neatness may
be maintained. He then reports the result to
the executive officer, receives his orders for
drill and returns to his station.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Upon the completion of muster the captain
will be informed of the number of absentees
and then this report is signaled to the flag-ship.</p>

<p>Upon such a scene Phil gazed for the first
time as an officer and thrilled to the impressive
ceremony. He stood at &#8220;attention&#8221; on
the right of the division.</p>

<p>Lazar, muster-book in hand, glanced along
the double line of men until his eyes rested
on his midshipman. The precision in the
attitude of his junior caught his eye. His
glance wavered and the slightest of sneers
appeared on his face. For the fraction of a
second he seemed to hesitate, then words that
brought the blush of shame and anger to the
face of the unsuspecting boy struck harshly
upon his ears:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, I gave you the credit for
knowing that at quarters all officers must
wear sword and gloves. Go below, sir, and
get yourself in proper uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil stood motionless. He was stunned for
the moment, not so much by the words as
by the scorn in his voice.</p>

<p>Almost overcome with confusion and embarrassment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
he turned away and hastily
descended the ladder to the deck below.</p>

<p>Once more in his room he found his sword
and gloves where he had placed them but ten
minutes before the call to quarters. Then
had come a call to the executive officer, and
once on deck all save the scene about him
was driven from his mind. His own thoughtlessness
alone could be blamed, but the sneer
in Lazar&#8217;s voice rankled.</p>

<p>When he again reached the deck, the men
had broken ranks and the sharp pipe of the
whistles of the boatswain and his mates
filled the air, followed in sonorous tones and
in perfect chorus:</p>

<p>&#8220;All hands unmoor ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stout hemp lines and chains securing
the battle-ship to the dock were cast off, and
like writhing serpents, hauled aboard by the
lusty crew. The two great propellers churned
the muddy water and the war-ship glided
out into the crowded waters of the East
River.</p>

<p>Two handy tugs attached themselves to
this unwieldy mass of steel and slowly
swung her armored bow toward the Brooklyn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Bridge, spanning the river like a huge rainbow
of metal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221; shouted the captain of the war-ship
to his tiny helpmates; then to the
attentive executive officer by his side&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slow speed ahead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quietly, the powerful engines started in
motion the sixteen thousand tons of fighting
material.</p>

<p>&#8220;Half speed ahead,&#8221; ordered the captain.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Bridge swept by overhead.
The docks and shipping melted into a confusion
of masts and smoke-stacks.</p>

<p>Through the harbor the battle-ship glided
like a great giant, then turned and headed
through the Narrows for the open sea.</p>

<p>The ship was soon well out on the Atlantic,
the haze of the city melted astern. The low
lying coast of Long Island was dimly in
sight on the port hand.</p>

<p>The two friends spent the remainder of the
day in getting their bearings in their new
home, and when eight o&#8217;clock came were quite
willing to seek their bunks.</p>

<p>It was midnight when Phil found himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
by Lazar&#8217;s side on the high bridge of the
battle-ship, as junior officer of the watch.</p>

<p>The wind, which had been light at the
start, had increased steadily in violence until
now the vessel was plunging heavily into the
teeth of a moderate gale. Her powerful
engines crowded her steel shod prow with
terrific force into the rising seas, flinging tons
of spray on to her high forecastle.</p>

<p>Lazar stood with his face close to the
canvass weather cloth, for the protection of
those on the bridge against the force of the
blast, and peered through the inky blackness.</p>

<p>The responsibility for the ship rested upon
his shoulders for the next four hours.</p>

<p>Turning toward the younger man, he motioned
him nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, your duties are to muster the
watch on deck,&#8221; he shouted in Phil&#8217;s ear, in
order to be heard in the roar of the wind;
&#8220;examine both life-boats; see that everything
movable about decks is secure. We are going
to have a bad night,&#8221; he added, glancing at
the angry sea. &#8220;Your duty is to go in the
life-boat if she is called away; but I shall not
lower a boat to-night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Phil glanced in amazement at the officer
of the deck. He could but see the outline of
his face in the gloom of his southwester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I understand you, sir, to say you
would not lower a life-boat to-night?&#8221; he
asked incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, you did,&#8221; snapped Lazar, &#8220;in this
sea to do so would mean sending seven men
to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil made his way aft, to where the watch
had gathered to keep dry against the heavy
seas of spray that periodically were flung over
the deck.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil held the lantern while Phil called
off the men&#8217;s names. Then he and O&#8217;Neil
climbed out and examined the life-boats, one
on each side, swung securely from their davits,
overhanging the angry water. Then Phil
went on the quarter-deck and questioned the
marine sentry at the patent life-buoy. Every
one seemed to be well instructed. All was
secure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your men from the side,&#8221; he cautioned
the boatswain&#8217;s mate of the watch; &#8220;we
don&#8217;t want any one overboard in a sea like
this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir,&#8221; replied the sailor, &#8220;there
ain&#8217;t any danger now; maybe when they hoists
ashes some of them lubberly firemen may
get too near the side. But I&#8217;ll warn &#8217;um,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Returning to his station on the bridge, he
sought the friendly shelter of the weather
cloth against the increasing fierceness of the
wind and stinging spray. The sound of flapping
canvas and the sea breaking its fury on
the steel bow were the only sounds above the
roar of the wind.</p>

<p>Phil counted not the time. All was too
new and absorbing. His thoughts had turned
to many things when his breathing stopped
and his heart sank as a terrifying cry from
aft came faintly but clearly to his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man overboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was rooted to the spot. In helpless
consternation he looked to his officer for instructions.
A human being was adrift in this
angry sea, or maybe had been already killed
by a swiftly moving propeller blade.</p>

<p>As in a dream he saw Lazar grasp the
handles of the telegraphs to the engine room
and signal &#8220;full speed astern.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>There could be but one interpretation.
Lazar would lower a life-boat after all.</p>

<p>Phil ran down the bridge ladder and swung
himself nimbly out on the life-boat gallery.</p>

<p>There he found the lee life-boat ready for
lowering; six sailors sat quietly at the thwarts,
while those of the watch had led out the boat-falls.
O&#8217;Neil, the coxswain, with his hand on
the strong-back, stood ready to leap into the
boat. That they were doing more than their
duty did not occur to these stout American
hearts. A fellow-being was in danger of
drowning&mdash;that was enough reason for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I lower, sir?&#8221; the coxswain shouted
to Phil as the latter swung himself over the
rail of the superstructure and stood by his
side; &#8220;he can&#8217;t live long in this sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil surveyed hastily the strongly built
boat, then his gaze traveled down to the angry
sea beneath him.</p>

<p>The engines were backing. He saw the
heavy surge of the sea astern as the propellers
threw a powerful race current forward. Why
did not the order come? After the ship had
started astern the boat could not be lowered.
Far away on the lee quarter the chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
flame of the patent life-buoy showed a dim
light against a background of troubled waters.</p>

<p>Under the spell of one of those impulses
that seem to take possession so absolutely of
the mind in times of emergency, Phil cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower away,&#8221; and he and O&#8217;Neil swung
themselves on board the life-boat as she
dropped evenly and quickly toward the black
sea beneath her.</p>

<p>Phil seized the handle of the steering oar in
both hands, motioning O&#8217;Neil away. The
boat shivered as she struck the lumpy sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit here, O&#8217;Neil, and hang on to my legs,&#8221;
shouted Phil at the top of his lungs, through
the roaring of the gale, as the boat shot ahead
on her life-line, while with the steering oar
he swung her stern in toward the white wall
of the battle-ship towering above them.</p>

<p>The life-line sheered the boat clear of the
menacing ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let go,&#8221; shouted the youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give way! Bend to it, men,&#8221; he cautioned,
turning the life-boat&#8217;s prow toward the
flicker of light appearing periodically on the
crest of a wave and quickly disappearing down
into its deep trough.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Straight-backed and supple the six oarsmen
sent the long, narrow boat over the seas that
seemed ready to engulf her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind me,&#8221; shouted Phil to O&#8217;Neil,
bracing his legs firmly against the stern
boards. &#8220;Stand by forward there, we shall
be at the life-buoy in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil glanced with grave concern at the
midshipman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir. Keep your weather eye
open, sir,&#8221; he cautioned. &#8220;If you go overboard
with them rubber boots on, you&#8217;ll go to
the bottom like a shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Protesting at the boy&#8217;s recklessness, he
crawled forward and stood ready to grasp the
man if he were clinging to the life-buoy or
yet swimming on the surface of the angry
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you see the buoy, sir?&#8221; shouted
O&#8217;Neil. &#8220;It&#8217;s broad off the starboard bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it,&#8221; shouted back Phil, as he threw
the stern to port and bore down on the
two flames still burning brightly amid the
tempest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand by to &#8216;peak your oars.&#8217; Peak!&#8221; he
shouted to the crew as the boat with a rush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
was brought around and headed up to the
buoy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s there, boys,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Neil, joyously,
as he leaned far out and grasped a limp,
bedraggled figure clinging to the life-buoy.
The men dropped the handles of their oars
between their feet, raising the blades clear of
the passing waves.</p>

<p>&#8220;In you come, my hearty,&#8221; cried the coxswain,
as his arms encircled the half-drowned
man, and he lifted him from the hungry sea
to safety in the life-boat.</p>

<p>Searchlights were now playing from the
battle-ship. One beam of light held steadily
on the struggling boat, while the others swept
fretfully about as if they sought to pierce the
dark water.</p>

<p>As the midshipman struggled manfully at
the steering oar, holding the bow of the boat
up against the impact of the powerful seas,
Lazar&#8217;s words seemed to ring in his ears like
a knell.</p>

<p>Fear clutched at his heart that he might
by his disobedience send these brave men to
a watery grave.</p>

<p>As long as the oarsmen could give the boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
headway, he felt confident all would go well,
but some of the men were exhausted, and the
sea was ever increasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, men! Give way together. This is
for your lives,&#8221; he shouted, as a white wall
of water reared itself close aboard out of the
blackness to windward.</p>

<p>The boat seemed to fairly crawl over the
angry bosom of foam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand by to peak your oars,&#8221; he shouted
hoarsely. &#8220;Peak!&#8221; as the monster wave
curled over, ready to engulf them, and struck
the bow of the life-boat. She shivered to her
keel and half filled with water, then lay dead
on the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>Wave after wave swept over the half-submerged
boat, almost drowning the exhausted
crew. Phil attempted frantically to head the
boat up to the battering seas.</p>

<p>Casting a despairing look at his men, whose
efforts were becoming ever weaker, he read on
their faces a look of hope. Throwing a swift
glance over his shoulder, he saw the misty
form of the &#8220;Connecticut&#8221; loom up out of
the darkness, scarce a boat&#8217;s length away.
He heard the whir of her backing propellers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the dull boom of the sea spending its
fury against her sides; the rapidly given
orders, and the scurry of shod feet on her
decks.</p>

<p>A line whistled overhead and fell in the
midst of the exhausted crew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a turn with that line,&#8221; Phil shouted.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil grasped the line and secured it to
the bow-thwart of the boat.</p>

<p>Phil braced himself against the jar of the
tautening line.</p>

<p>The boat rose and fell on the angry sea, in
momentary danger of splitting herself asunder
on the sides of the battle-ship. The waves,
but half broken by the armored bow, swept
over the struggling men.</p>

<p>He felt himself grasped and held strongly
by hands from above, and then slowly hauled
upward. He saw the whole boat lifted on a
giant sea and then swept wildly against the
ship&#8217;s steel side. A crash of splintered wood.
Then all was darkness.</p>

<p>Phil opened his eyes in his own room, with
Sydney and Marshall bending over him and
a doctor binding up a cut over his temple.
Two or three times he attempted to speak, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
find out the worst. He knew that the life of
every man sacrificed was caused by his impulse.
He had given the order to lower the
boat directly contrary to the stated instructions
of the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>He had not the courage to ask of the fate
of his men. He had seen the boat go to
pieces with his own eyes, surely some of the
crew had been drowned.</p>

<p>He could not stand the suspense a moment
longer. He must know all. It would be
better than this uncertainty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, tell me what happened?&#8221; he whispered
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;All were saved,&#8221; Sydney answered. &#8220;We
abandoned the boat, of course. You were
struck by a splinter as you were being hauled
on board. You are the biggest man on this
ship to-night, Phil.&#8221;</p>

<p>The joyful news made the overwrought boy
tremble. He turned his face away to hide
his emotion.</p>

<p>Greatly strengthened by the happy tidings,
he put on dry clothes and, despite Sydney&#8217;s
offer to stand the remainder of his watch,
made his way to the bridge to report his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
return to Lazar. It seemed an age since he
had responded to that terrifying cry, but the
clock told him it had been but scarce a half
hour ago.</p>

<p>What would Lazar say? Would not success
wipe away the guilt of disobedience?
What was the loss of a boat compared to the
loss of a human life?</p>

<p>With a cheerful ring in his voice he reported
his return to duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was struck by a piece of the boat, sir,&#8221;
he offered in excuse for his tardiness. The
ship had been on her course for nearly ten
minutes.</p>

<p>Lazar turned on him fiercely. His even
white teeth gleamed under his black moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can thank Providence, Mr. Perry, that
you are alive this moment.&#8221; His voice rose
in anger. &#8220;A midshipman who cannot obey
orders is a menace to the safety of those under
him. That you were not all drowned was due
to me, sir. I saved you by putting the ship
between your boat and the seas, and hauling
you aboard like so much cargo.&#8221; Then in a
voice cold and passionless: &#8220;I have received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the captain&#8217;s authority, Mr. Perry, to place
you under arrest for wilfully disobeying my
order. You will go to your room, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil turned away without a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Brace</span> up and don&#8217;t pull such a long face,
Phil,&#8221; Sydney was saying in their room after
breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the boast of the ship, and the
captain will not be severe with you. You
disobeyed orders, of course, but so did Admiral
Nelson at the battle of the Nile, and yet he was
promoted for his action because he &#8216;made
good&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I didn&#8217;t &#8216;make good.&#8217; Lazar
&#8216;made good&#8217; for me and he took pains to tell
me so last night. I would rather have drowned
than listen to his scornful denunciation of my
conduct,&#8221; answered Phil sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are entirely too sensitive,&#8221; answered
Sydney in a disgusted voice. &#8220;If I had been
in your place last night I&#8217;d have been proud of
myself, and Lazar&#8217;s scorn would be as water
on a duck&#8217;s back. Every one is for you, even
Mr. Penfield, the executive officer. I hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
he said at the wardroom mess-table that he
was of the opinion that you should be publicly
commended by the secretary of the navy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil blushed with pleasure at his friend&#8217;s
impetuous words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he, though?&#8221; he said, brightly; then
his face clouded as his eyes fell on his empty
sword rack.</p>

<p>&#8220;The humiliation of the arrest is what
hurts,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When the captain sent
for my sword I felt like a veritable
traitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are, sentiment again,&#8221; cried
Sydney. &#8220;The sword is merely a matter of
form. You will have it again in a jiffy. I&#8217;m
coming back as soon as we anchor,&#8221; he added,
buckling on his sword and hurriedly leaving
the room as the bugle call sounded, and the
boatswain&#8217;s mates&#8217; hoarse voices were heard
calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring ship to an anchor!&#8221;</p>

<p>Throwing himself into his chair, Phil turned
over in his mind the various incidents that
had led to his arrest. How could he answer
Lazar&#8217;s accusations? His only manly course
was to acknowledge his guilt and hope for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
captain&#8217;s clemency. Down in his heart he
knew he would do the same again. It was
cruel to stand by and see a man perish without
raising a hand. Yet Lazar&#8217;s judgment
had been sound. For the benefit of many it
were better to allow one to drown.</p>

<p>Alone in his room he followed the movements
of the ship by the noises about him.
As the vibrations of the propellers lessened, he
knew that the vessel was near the anchored
fleet and had slowed her engines. Shortly,
he heard the rattle of chain as the anchor was
dropped overboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, the captain wishes to see Mr. Perry in
the cabin,&#8221; announced the orderly five minutes
later.</p>

<p>Entering the cabin, Phil removed his cap
and stood with military exactness before his
commanding officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a seat, Mr. Perry,&#8221; said the captain,
not unkindly.</p>

<p>A few moments elapsed, then Lazar entered,
and at a motion from the captain occupied a
chair next to Phil.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart beat fast. The solemnity of the
occasion awed him. His hopes were ready to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
sink within him as he waited for the captain&#8217;s
decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; the captain began, weighing
his words, &#8220;Mr. Perry, in deliberately disobeying
the order of his senior officer, helped
to save an unfortunate man from certain
death;&#8221; the captain hesitated and shifted his
gaze to Lazar. &#8220;If it had not been for the
masterful manner in which the officer of the
deck, Mr. Lazar, handled the ship, placing
her between the helpless boat and the force of
the seas, eight more men would have been sacrificed.&#8221;
Then turning to Phil and addressing
him directly: &#8220;It was Mr. Lazar&#8217;s high
sense of duty that compelled him to report
your disobedience. What have you to say,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was silent. The captain thrummed
on the table, as if impatient for an answer.
Lazar fidgeted uneasily in his chair, no doubt
wondering what defense the boy would advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to say, sir,&#8221; began Phil in
a low voice. &#8220;I committed a grave error, sir.
I have steered life-boats before, but the sea
was greater than I realized.&#8221; He stopped and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
glanced up in embarrassment at the captain.
&#8220;I am afraid, sir, I would do the same again,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well spoken, lad,&#8221; cried the captain delightedly.
He had prepared himself for an
excuse, so this straightforward acknowledgment
was extremely gratifying to the blunt
sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you, boy, you gave me a few new
white hairs as I watched your boat. I never
thought to see any of that crew again, but all&#8217;s
well that ends well, eh, Lazar?&#8221; he asked,
turning suddenly on the ensign.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel I have done my duty, sir; the verdict
rests with you,&#8221; answered he, in a strained
voice, in which Phil thought he read disappointment.</p>

<p>The captain became grave, apparently noting
the attitude of the claimant. &#8220;That is all,
Mr. Lazar,&#8221; he said in a changed voice.
&#8220;You may withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the door closed on the ensign, the captain&#8217;s
face again assumed a kindly expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, I cannot find heart to punish
you for this,&#8221; he spoke earnestly. &#8220;You were
too impulsive and it might have turned out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
disastrously, nevertheless it became you well.
You have shown that you are made of the
right stuff; now let me see you fashion it into
the officer that you are capable of becoming.&#8221;
Reaching out his hand he took up Phil&#8217;s
sword, and as he returned it to him, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, obedience is your first duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; Sydney cried, shaking
Phil&#8217;s hand a moment later, as he returned
with his sword. Then in an anxious voice:
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like Lazar&#8217;s attitude. He came out
of the cabin a minute ago looking like a thunder-cloud.
He apparently was not pleased at
the captain&#8217;s decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may dislike me,&#8221; Phil answered charitably,
as they entered their own room, &#8220;but
I believe so far he has treated me as he would
have any of us midshipmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The life-boat incident raised Phil to a high
place in the opinions of most officers of the
ship, and the men were all devoted to him.
He was their favorite midshipman after that.</p>

<p>This was the first time the eight big battle-ships
of the Atlantic fleet had been together
since their winter rendezvous at Guantanamo,
Cuba, and good-natured rivalry between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
ships in tests of strength and physical prowess
of their crews ran high. The admiral of the
fleet, a great believer in encouraging these pastimes,
had given orders for a track meet to be
held on shore, and all hands turned to organize
their forces to win the pennant to be
given to the ship that showed herself capable
of producing the cleverest athletes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been pressed into service to get the
entries from our ship for the meet,&#8221; Marshall
announced at the mess-table that evening.
&#8220;It is to take place next Saturday. We need
all the good men we can get. We certainly
have a prize in Lazar; he has entered for all
the short runs up to the 440-yards. He held
all the Annapolis records for them when he
was there, and he keeps himself in fine condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had brightened up at the prospects for
a day of field sports, and held his hand out
gladly for the paper to put down his name,
but when Lazar&#8217;s name passed Marshall&#8217;s lips,
his face clouded and he withdrew his hand
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, you should do something in the jumping
line,&#8221; said Phil in a voice of feigned indifference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t enter; I&#8217;m not in form for
running.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you crazy, man?&#8221; Sydney cried.
Then turning to Marshall: &#8220;He made a
clean sweep last year of the short runs at Annapolis,
lowered one record and equaled the
others. Don&#8217;t listen to him, he is only
modest; put him down for all up to the 440.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried Phil earnestly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
going to enter, so that ends it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have no more ship&#8217;s spirit than
that, you can go hang,&#8221; replied Marshall,
much nettled at Phil&#8217;s stubbornness.</p>

<p>Sydney allowed his name to be written on
the entry sheet for several events, but the
sheet went back to Lieutenant-Commander
Penfield, the executive officer, without Phil&#8217;s
name for a single event.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Phil?&#8221; demanded
Sydney, in their room after dinner.
&#8220;Why should you refuse when you know you
are in excellent condition and could win the
majority of your races? Is it because Lazar
has entered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you must know,&#8221; he replied in a
tone of finality. &#8220;I&#8217;d sooner stay away and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
retain my peace of mind. Our relations are
strained enough already. I have no wish to
incur his further enmity. We would hotly
contest each event, and if I won, his treatment
of me would not be improved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney&#8217;s further persuasions fell on barren
soil. Phil held to his point and would not be
moved.</p>

<p>Great preparations were being made for the
coming struggle. Enthusiasm waxed high in
the fleet, and all longed for the day to arrive
when each could test his prowess.</p>

<p>The day of the meet finally came; the sun
shone from a cloudless pure sky; the cool sea
breeze swept over the athletic grounds, invigorating
the hundreds of sailor athletes with
its salty crispness. This was an event new in
the annals of the navy, and had aroused intense
interest, so when the lads arrived with
their party of contestants from the &#8220;Connecticut,&#8221;
they found an audience had collected
from the surrounding country. The grand
stands, erected by the carpenters of the ships
of the fleet, were packed to overflowing, while
the field, which had been turned into an arena
for the many contests, was gay with the uniformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
sailormen who had come to cheer their
champions.</p>

<p>On a bulletin-board at the entrance to the
grounds the lists of those to compete in the
several events was posted.</p>

<p>So much pressure had been brought to bear
upon Phil that he had finally been prevailed
upon to enter the short runs. The executive
officer and even the captain had upbraided
him so severely for what they thought was
his lack of ship&#8217;s spirit, that he had, much
against his inclinations, allowed his name to
be put on the list before it was sent to the
flag-ship.</p>

<p>Our two boys stopped to read the names of
the competitors. Many of those entering were
strangers, but an occasional name would evoke
a remark of surprise or pleasure from one or
the other of the readers.</p>

<p>Lazar&#8217;s name was in but one list, that for
the 100-yard run, and Phil wondered whether
the latter had withdrawn because he had entered.
The next minute Marshall came rushing
up to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lazar is running only in the 100-yard. I
suppose you noticed his name is not in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
others. I have just seen him and he seems
confident of being able to win the race. Now,
if you can win the others and run second in
this short dash, we shall win the pennant
hands down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil immediately bristled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say I might run second?&#8221; he
asked quickly.</p>

<p>Marshall hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean, Perry,&#8221; he answered
knowingly; &#8220;after your other races
you can hardly expect to beat Lazar, but if
you try for second, you can get it. Don&#8217;t
you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that his suggestion?&#8221; Phil asked, his
anger rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be frank with you, yes, it is,&#8221; confessed
Marshall. &#8220;He found that the three races
were being run too close together, so he
scratched in the others and thinks he is sure
for the shorter run. It&#8217;s all perfectly square.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, maybe so,&#8221; Phil answered shortly,
as he turned toward the dressing-tent to be
ready for the first race in which he was entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Second,&#8217; eh?&#8221; he soliloquized. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give him the race of his life for first.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>The races were run amid great enthusiasm
as the sailors saw the possibility for the winner
gradually narrow down until the coveted
pennant lay between but two ships, the &#8220;Connecticut&#8221;
and the &#8220;Minnesota.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have just a half hour to rest up before
the first heat of the big race,&#8221; said Sydney,
as he and Phil walked toward the hospital
tent after the 440-yard run.</p>

<p>Phil felt the strain of his two races. He
had won the 220-yards by a narrow margin,
but had been cleverly outstripped in the longer
race by a sailorman from the &#8220;Minnesota.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney had acquitted himself with credit;
he had taken second place in two of the
jumping contests.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be a hot favorite for the
100-yards, Mr. Perry,&#8221; said the doctor, with
a smile of admiration at the well-knit figure
before him, as he directed his nurses to rub
the strained muscles to keep them in shape
for the final contest. &#8220;I hear the pennant
lies between your ship and the &#8216;Minnesota.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Marshall came into the tent, and unabashed
at the rebuke administered by Phil earlier in
the day, began his argument anew:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t like Lazar any too
well,&#8221; he said in an undertone, &#8220;and because
he suggested this, you immediately became
angry, but let me show you a perfectly fair
way of doing it, without blocking anybody.
Say Lazar can win, then leaving yourself out
of the count, some one will run second. Now
don&#8217;t try to catch Lazar, but keep ahead of
the man who threatens him and takes second
place. If you overexert yourself to pass
Lazar you may give out and be beaten by
two or three men. That is surely fair in a
contest between ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose I feel confident I can beat
Lazar and win,&#8221; answered Phil dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too much to expect, Perry,&#8221; said
he earnestly. &#8220;After running as you have it&#8217;s
only natural that you cannot be in as good
condition as if you hadn&#8217;t run, and we must
take both first and second place in this last
race to be sure of beating the &#8216;Minnesota.&#8217;
She leads us now by nearly ten points. Can&#8217;t
you do this for your ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was silent. He believed the proposition
as far as Marshall was concerned was
prompted solely by a desire to see his ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
win, but as coming from Lazar it was a slur
on his manliness. The latter had hinted at
blocking off the fast runners, pocketing them
by keeping ahead and preventing their passing
him, thus insuring a win for Lazar if he
succeeded in getting off quickly, which was
his greatest asset; he was the quickest starter
Phil had ever seen. But even in the form
outlined by Marshall, although it might not
be considered unfair, yet it was unsportsmanlike
and savored of jockeying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry I can&#8217;t see it your way, old
man,&#8221; he answered finally in not an unkind
voice; then the indignation he felt for Lazar
blazed from his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may tell Mr. Lazar I shall run to
win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you, Phil,&#8221; cried Sydney delightedly.
He had listened intently in
silence, and was afraid he might be influenced
by the plausible arguments of his tempter.
&#8220;I&#8217;d be willing to have the ship lose to see
you beat him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The preliminary heats were run amid great
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Lazar and Phil, with eight others, found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
themselves at the starting line for the final
test.</p>

<p>Phil, in spite of the tax on his strength in
his hard fought races, never felt in better
trim. The earlier races assured him that his
muscles had not deteriorated. As he stood
with his body thrown forward, hands on the
ground in front of him, he vibrated like a
highly tempered spring. Every muscle was
held in the leash, ready to be loosed by his
will at the discharge of the pistol. He wished
that he might be transformed into a knight
of older times, horsed and about to &#8220;enter the
lists&#8221; with his antagonist. How he would
delight to see Lazar&#8217;s pride unhorsed beneath
his charger&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>With these mad thoughts coursing through
his brain he heard, as if from far away, the
starter&#8217;s voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On your mark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a pause, followed by a loud report.</p>

<p>As if shot from a catapult, the lithe figures
darted forward&mdash;breath held tightly, every
face set with dogged determination.</p>

<p>Phil saw Lazar dart two yards ahead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
every competitor. It was an enormous
handicap in his favor, for it precluded a
chance of being pocketed either by accident
or design.</p>

<p>Phil strained his muscles to their utmost
in an endeavor to free himself from the mass
of threatening, surging runners. If each ran
inside his chalk line all would be well, but
on the sandy soil marks were indistinct. He
held his breath a prisoner. His old trainer
at Annapolis had taught him the trick.
&#8220;A full breath at &#8216;on your mark&#8217; and another
thirty yards from the finish. It&#8217;s all
the air you need,&#8221; were the words repeating
themselves in his mind. His exertions were
crowned by finding himself within a yard of
Lazar. The next danger thundered three
yards behind him.</p>

<p>Swiftly they drew toward the finish.</p>

<p>Lazar, running in his chalked lane, edged
over inch by inch until he was directly in
Phil&#8217;s path. The man behind had now drawn
up so close to Phil that he could feel his
hot breath in his ear. He knew him for the
little sailor who had beaten him in the
440-yard run. Phil was now running on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the left edge of the course. The runner
behind him was in the line that had been
Lazar&#8217;s. If Phil were not to be pocketed
he must pass Lazar to his right and might
thereby interfere with and perhaps foul the
plucky little runner from the &#8220;Minnesota.&#8221;
Phil knew that if the latter ran first or
second the pennant would go to the sailor&#8217;s
ship. In all its hideousness Lazar&#8217;s trick
flashed before Phil&#8217;s eyes. Lazar would make
him pocket the sailor or else be beaten by
both men. With the eye of a runner he
judged the time for his full breath and final
spurt had come.</p>

<p>Slowly he drew up abreast of Lazar; the
third man was close at his elbow. He put
forth his full power. To himself his muscles
felt chained. He seemed fairly to crawl toward
the finish. But the spectators saw him
draw surely up to Lazar&mdash;then forge ahead.
Phil heard a pistol shot, and gave himself
into the grasp of a group of sailormen.
He knew none of them, but they all wore
&#8220;Connecticut&#8221; on their caps, and their faces
were alight with pride and satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done, Mr. Perry,&#8221; they shouted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>He felt himself raised on a mountain of
sturdy shoulders and heard the triumphant
shouts of victory.</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell on the face of Lazar,
likewise honored by his delighted men.
Amid the happy faces below him that of
the older officer showed only anger and bitter
mortification.</p>

<small>THE FACE IN THE LOCKET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sports</span> of whatever nature were now by the
order of the admiral relegated to the past and
all hands turned to for the coming target
practice.</p>

<p>With the Atlantic fleet the days were now
indeed full of hard, but useful work.</p>

<p>At eight o&#8217;clock in the morning the
squadron would daily be under way. Drill
after drill followed to perfect the officers in
handling the unwieldy monsters, until even
the ships seemed to have acquired an intelligence
all their own.</p>

<p>Phil, standing his watch duty under Lazar,
spent many instructive hours. To see the
eight battle-ships steaming at twelve-knots
speed, with a distance between the bow of one
and the stern of the next of less than three
ship lengths, was a sight calculated to inspire
a feeling of wonder and admiration.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>One day on the bridge, while the squadron
was engaged in maneuvers, the real danger
of this apparently simple drill was forcibly
demonstrated. Phil, telescope in hand, was
reading the fluttering flags hoisted by the
flag-ship, calling out the numbers to Lazar,
who was solving their meaning in the signal
book he held in his hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly the battle-ship directly ahead in
the column swung herself across the path of
their ship. Phil saw the &#8220;dispatch flag,&#8221; a
signal of breakdown, flying at her main masthead.
The danger of a collision appeared so
suddenly that he was bound to the spot. He
was new to such an emergency. Lazar&#8217;s eyes
were upon the ship ahead. His attitude was
alert, his face calm and his manner deliberate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Port, hard aport,&#8221; he ordered, in a natural
voice.</p>

<p>The heavily-shod bow of their ship pointed
fairly amidships of the ship now nearly broadside
in their path.</p>

<p>Slowly, painfully the &#8220;Connecticut&#8217;s&#8221; bow,
in answer to her helm, moved along the
length of the exposed and all but helpless
white hull ahead. The ships drew together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
with such rapidity that it seemed to Phil a
collision was inevitable.</p>

<p>Such were undoubtedly the thoughts on
board the ship ahead. The shrill screech of
her syren screamed across the water&mdash;a signal
for all on board immediately to close every
door and scuttle throughout the ship, so that
in the event of a collision the water entering
the wounded side would be prevented from
spreading throughout the ship and endangering
her buoyancy.</p>

<p>Lazar&#8217;s actions showed not a sign of indecision.
He appeared as cool as if he were
performing an ordinary maneuver of routine
duty.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Connecticut&#8221; cleared her prostrated
mate and swung by her swiftly&mdash;so close
aboard that it seemed to Phil that they must
have touched, then she followed in the wake
of the other ships.</p>

<p>The boy was filled with admiration for the
officer. He wondered if he would ever be
able to use such remarkable judgment and
remain as tranquil.</p>

<p>The more he saw of the older man the
more he regretted their common enmity. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
an officer he could not but command his
respect. He was capable and self-possessed
under the most trying circumstances, and
yet, in spite of this enviable talent, he lacked
the power of endearing himself to those under
him. There was hardly a sailor on the ship
who liked him. As a rule he was silent, yet
the man who displeased him awakened a
tongue so bitter that its sting covered the
unfortunate one with shame and confusion.
Those of his own mess admired him for his
seamanlike ability, but despised him for his
cynical and abusive disposition. He confided
in no one, was friendly with none.</p>

<p>With such a personality Phil found himself
closely associated, both in his duty on
deck and also in the turret, where hard work
was their daily portion. Lazar was ambitious,
and he spared neither his men nor himself in
building up such efficiency that the turret he
commanded could not be outstripped in its
record by any other of its class.</p>

<p>Phil had no real grounds for complaint.
Lazar&#8217;s biting cynicisms hurt his pride, but
only spurred him on to further efforts to perfect
himself in his duties.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;Come out with us, Phil,&#8221; cried Sydney,
the day before target practice, to his roommate,
hard at work over some knotty problem.
&#8220;You take things too seriously. Let
it alone for awhile. We are going for a row
in the dinghy, to the beach, and have a swim.
Marshall, Morrison and Hill are going. You
will just make a crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face brightened at the prospect, but
remembering his work, he shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I must work this out first. It&#8217;s very
irritating. I know there must be a way, but
I can&#8217;t see how to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are working entirely too hard,&#8221; replied
Sydney, earnestly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t worth it.
What credit does Lazar give you? He never
has a word to say unless it&#8217;s to correct a mistake
in his sarcastic voice. It makes me angry
to see you slave for him. Come out with us
and harden up your muscles.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Phil could not be moved. His interest
had been aroused in this work and he would
master it before he gave in.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he thought, when the pleasure
seekers had gone, &#8220;what do I care for Lazar&#8217;s
praise. He has taught me to curb my temper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and I have worked harder than I thought
myself capable in order to be free from his
faultfinding tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>The problem was only one of many Phil
had fought out alone, and he finally saw the
solution. Putting his drawings aside, he went
up into the turret to test his ideas practically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boyd,&#8221; he shouted as he reached the gun
platform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, sir,&#8221; answered a slim, active looking
sailorman, the gunner&#8217;s mate of the turret,
emerging from under the guns, a number of
tools in his begrimed fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get O&#8217;Neil and come down below in the
handling room. I have a scheme I want to
try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir,&#8221; answered Boyd with alacrity,
putting his wrenches in the tool-racks. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get him and join you in a second, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He disappeared through the smoke hatch to
the top of the turret.</p>

<p>Phil glanced about him. The objects which
to him three weeks ago seemed so confusing
were now wonderfully simple: the guns in
their massive steel carriages, the weighty
cylinders with their internal pistons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
springs to check the force of the recoil when
the guns are fired and send them back again
to their normal position without undue jar to
the structure of the ship. Here were the
electric ammunition hoists, reeling a stout wire
about a metal drum and this bringing up the
heavy ammunition car with its burden of shell
and powder from the handling room fifty feet
below, and placing the charge directly in front
of the open breech of the guns, to be driven
home by the swiftly moving electric rammers.
Phil saw below him the twin motors which
turned the massive turret at the will of man.
All these, to their minutest detail, were clear
to him. Did other midshipmen master as
much in so short a time? Was it not an advantage
to serve under a man who could inspire
such a desire to learn, even though the
craving for knowledge was aroused by a determination
to be free from his sarcastic
taunts?</p>

<p>Standing thus deep in thought, the stillness
in the turret was broken by a sound from below.
It was faint but distinct. He listened
with held breath. It seemed to be caused by
a file against a metal surface. He could see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
nothing. The heavy iron shutters, built to
protect the crew of the handling room from
accidents in the turret, were shut tightly.</p>

<p>The sound continued, seemingly becoming
louder. Then it ceased and a metal object
rattled on the deck below. It was so clear and
distinct that he thought it must be caused by
Boyd in the handling room. Doubtlessly he
was already there awaiting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boyd,&#8221; he raised his voice in order to be
heard beyond the shutters.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>He called again louder. The sound of footsteps
came to his ears from the handling room.
What could it mean? By Lazar&#8217;s orders no
work was to be done in the turret or handling
room by any one save Boyd, and he had just
gone up the hatch, and if he were below he
would have answered his call.</p>

<p>Phil swung himself down the ladder, through
the scuttle in the turret platform, then down
a second ladder, and found himself in darkness
on the floor of the handling room.</p>

<p>All was silence.</p>

<p>Presently he heard his name called from
above in the voice of Boyd. What could it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
mean? Some one had been there but a second
ago and what had he been doing?</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn the light on down here,&#8221; he called
back. His heart beat wildly.</p>

<p>The electric lights flashed as the switch was
turned from above.</p>

<p>The handling room was empty.</p>

<p>A glint from a small bright object caught
his eye in the shadow of an ammunition car.
He stooped down and picked up a gold locket.
Could it be a clew to the mystery? The
thing was harmless enough in itself.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil and Boyd quickly joined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been doing any repair work
here?&#8221; he asked the gunner&#8217;s mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, everything is right here, barring
that shell car you were figuring on,&#8221; answered
he promptly.</p>

<p>Phil held the locket in his open palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask the men of the division if any of
them lost a locket,&#8221; he spoke carelessly. &#8220;If
one claims it send him to me,&#8221; he added,
dropping the trinket in his pocket.</p>

<p>His experiments successfully over, he carefully
surveyed the different familiar objects
about him. All seemed normal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;The noises must have come from the shaft
alleys or engine room,&#8221; he said softly to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you speak, sir?&#8221; inquired O&#8217;Neil, hearing
his low voice.</p>

<p>Phil glanced up with the intention of confiding
in his petty officer, then changed his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I was only thinking,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>Arriving in his room he tried to dismiss the
incident from his mind. He still held the
locket in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the men dropped it during drill,&#8221;
he assured himself. But instinctively his
eyes traveled back to the locket as if it were a
talisman. A feeling took possession of him
that if he opened the locket the clew would
be inside. But he controlled this feeling. It
would not be honorable to open it.</p>

<p>He regretted that Lazar was away&mdash;on board
the &#8220;Minnesota,&#8221; umpiring her target practice.
If he were here he would tell him of
his fears; then he could do as he thought best.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe Syd is right,&#8221; he said half aloud;
&#8220;this close application to work has gotten on
my nerves. I take things too seriously. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
hear a noise in the turret, and the ship being
a regular sounding-board, it may have come
from anywhere. Then why should I take for
granted it came from the handling room?
And then I find a small gold locket which I
at once take as a sure sign that I am right in
my conjecture.&#8221; Then his thoughts became
more serious. &#8220;But if it was in the handling
room, it shows that some one was there who
had no business there, because when I called
he did not answer. Could any one wish
to injure the turret gear? Had Lazar an
enemy?&#8221;</p>

<p>For hours that night he lay awake revolving
in his mind all the possible phases of the
incident and at last dropped into a troubled
sleep.</p>

<p>Awakening the next morning he was in a
state of mental depression. An overpowering
desire to open the locket came to him which
he could not refuse. He took it out of his
bureau drawer and forced the tiny thing open.
A girl&#8217;s face looked out at him. He studied
it carefully, then closed the locket and threw
it back into the drawer with a gesture of disappointment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;I wonder what I expected to find there,&#8221;
he said with a sarcastic smile. &#8220;My nerves
are in about the same condition as those of a
man before his first battle. I shall certainly
be happy when it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lazar is in the turret, sir,&#8221; announced
O&#8217;Neil, putting his head in the midshipman&#8217;s
mess room, while Phil was eating his breakfast,
&#8220;and he&#8217;d like to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are to fire as soon as the umpires arrive,
Mr. Perry,&#8221; Lazar informed him as the
midshipman crawled down through the scuttle
and stood by his side between the two big
guns.</p>

<p>Phil wavered in his inclination to inform
his division officer of the incident of the day
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;The umpires are here, sir, and the captain
says you will fire first. Let him know when
you are ready to go on the range,&#8221; reported
the orderly, from the turret top.</p>

<p>Phil found himself at his station in the
handling room. The mystery was still a
secret.</p>

<p>All thoughts of the affair were quickly forgotten.
His mind was now on the work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
supplying ammunition from the magazines
and shell rooms as fast as the two metal tubes
above could hurl it at the target.</p>

<p>The shell rooms were opened and the big
shells were brought out on the overhead tracks
ready to be placed on the ammunition cars,
then to be hoisted to the turret fifty feet above.
The magazine doors were closed, but the
hinged metal flaps were undogged and men
stood ready to enter the powder magazines
and pass the charges of powder through these
fire-proof flaps to those in the handling room,
then to be placed with the shell on the car.</p>

<p>Standing surrounded by his twenty-four
men, Phil waited the order from Lazar to load
the cars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; Lazar&#8217;s voice came down the
flexible speaking-tube.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir,&#8221; Phil answered back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready, sir,&#8221; shouted Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Load!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cars were loaded and raised, and a second
shell for each was brought out, ready to
be put on the cars as soon as they came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are off,&#8221; Phil shouted excitedly, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
both cars were hoisted with terrific speed up
the curved steel rails; the shutters between the
turret and handling room opened obediently
to allow the cars to pass; a glimpse of half-naked
men above them came into view, then
they fell shut with a bang, shutting out the
scene.</p>

<p>A dull crash from above told those in the
handling room that the first gun had been
fired.</p>

<p>An empty ammunition car came down
through the shutter, was quickly supplied
with its shell and powder and again disappeared
upward through the magic shutter.</p>

<p>The firing above was rapid. The empty
cars appeared so frequently that the men below
were hard pressed to prevent the crews
above from waiting for their ammunition.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the fastest firing I have ever seen,&#8221;
cried one of the men in admiration, as he
hurled a fifty pound powder bag accurately on
to its shelf in the car; &#8220;they ain&#8217;t nothing in
the fleet can touch this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saw with consternation the car start up
prematurely with but one bag of powder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
where four were necessary for a charge. It
would have to go clear to the turret and then
come down again for the other three bags, a
loss of much precious time.</p>

<p>As if he thought he might call the impatient
car back, he watched it gather speed to
open the shutter. He saw it disappear and
the shutter close behind it with a rasping
noise. Then came a crash as of a heavy falling
body, from above. The din of tearing
metal filled his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand clear, men,&#8221; he had barely time to
shout, when the loaded car, shutter and all,
shot down into their midst, a hopeless mass
of twisted metal.</p>

<small>HURRIED ORDERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> accident came so unexpectedly that it
was some moments before Phil could find his
voice. Then he realized there was nothing to
be done. The damage was beyond his capacity
to repair. The turret was useless for further
service.</p>

<p>He glanced, apprehensively, upward through
the jagged rent of the shutter and his eyes fell
upon the angry, excited face of his divisional
officer.</p>

<p>There was small reason to ask the trouble.
The dangling end of the wire rope told the
story only too plainly: the hoist rope had
broken when the ammunition car was nearly
at the breech of the gun, and it had then
plunged downward, with its burden of nearly
a ton of shell and powder, wrecking itself and
the shutter.</p>

<p>A moment later Lazar was in the handling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
room, viewing the effects of the unlucky accident.</p>

<p>Stooping down he raised the car end of the
wire rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut half through,&#8221; he cried in a voice
full of passion, &#8220;and by a file or saw.&#8221; His
disappointment was too keen to conceal.</p>

<p>&#8220;All my work for nothing. The umpires
will decide the accident against me, and only
half the firing over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil felt sorry for the older man. He
would willingly take the blame on himself,
if that could have helped matters.</p>

<p>These charitable thoughts were however
quickly stifled by the humiliating words of
his superior officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;This looks like your work,&#8221; he hissed in
Phil&#8217;s ear. &#8220;I have no way to prove it, but
it looks very black for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, sir!&#8221; he gasped. Then the thought of
the locket and his secret came to him. He
stopped vexed and mortified.</p>

<p>It did look black, indeed.</p>

<p>Lazar gave him a swift glance of triumph
as he turned away.</p>

<p>Phil directed the work of clearing away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the wreck and as soon as the ship&#8217;s machinists
had commenced on the repairs, he hunted up
his friend to make a clean breast to him of
the secret which had grown in a night from a
mole-hill to the size of a mountain.</p>

<p>He found Sydney in his room, washing the
evidence of target practice from his face and
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made a fine score,&#8221; Sydney cried joyously,
without looking up, as Phil entered
their small stateroom. &#8220;What on earth happened?
Your turret started out finely;
every shot hit the target, then suddenly
you stopped shooting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything happened,&#8221; answered Phil,
sadly. &#8220;The ammunition hoist broke and
Lazar thinks it&#8217;s my work, and the only way
I can clear myself is to get myself further
implicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that certainly is Irish,&#8221; laughed
Sydney heartily; then a view of his friend&#8217;s
face cut short his mirth, for he saw that it
was serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Phil,&#8221; he added
soberly, &#8220;but your words were droll. Tell
me about it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Phil unburdened himself to his roommate;
telling of the noise that he had heard
in the handling room the day before; of his
suspicions, and of the fatal mistake he had
made in not confiding in Lazar before the
firing commenced; then of the accident and
Lazar&#8217;s accusations.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should he accuse you?&#8221; Sydney
asked aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but he has,&#8221; Phil answered,
&#8220;and I was struck dumb. I can&#8217;t explain
to him now. It would only make things
worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney thought deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil, the idea is preposterous,&#8221; he said
decidedly; &#8220;he certainly has better sense than
to accuse you openly of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the worst of it,&#8221; Phil answered
sorrowfully; &#8220;all he need do is to cast a
suspicion on me and then I must endeavor to
clear myself of the suspicion, and I can&#8217;t.
If I tell what I have told you, those who are
ready to believe I am capable of doing such a
cowardly act to spite Lazar, will see all the
more proof that I am guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely is complicated,&#8221; Sydney replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Phil opened his desk drawer and picked
up the locket, holding it out to Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what I found in the handling
room. There&#8217;s a girl&#8217;s picture inside. It
doesn&#8217;t belong to any of the turret&#8217;s crew, at
least none have claimed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This was dropped by the man who cut
the wire,&#8221; Sydney mused aloud, &#8220;and this
face may help us find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so mysterious, Syd,&#8221; cried Phil
impatiently; &#8220;how can that girl&#8217;s face help
us? There is probably no likeness between
it and the culprit. It&#8217;s the face of his sweetheart,
undoubtedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but the fact that her face is here will
cause him to try to regain it,&#8221; Sydney answered
assuredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe that Lazar would recognize
the face in the locket?&#8221; Phil questioned.
&#8220;I might show it to him without telling him
of the noise I heard before finding it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was about to suggest,&#8221;
replied Sydney; &#8220;the man who did the act
is an enemy of Lazar&#8217;s; he may recognize
the girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil immediately sought Lazar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Come in.&#8221; Lazar&#8217;s voice answered the
knock on his stateroom door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221; he said discourteously,
without rising. &#8220;Well, what do you want
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was confounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a locket here which I found in the
handling room yesterday while I was working
on the cars,&#8221; he began hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Lazar took the locket in his hand, then
glanced up at the face of the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he inquired coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a face inside,&#8221; Phil stammered.
&#8220;I thought you might know the owner in
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lazar opened the locket, and if Phil had
not been so much occupied nursing his injured
dignity, he might have seen a flash
of recognition in Lazar&#8217;s face. However,
when he looked up it had passed away
and a look of boredom had taken its
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know her,&#8221; he answered
shortly, handing Phil the locket. &#8220;Is that
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all, sir.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_076.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;WELL?&#8221; HE INQUIRED,<br />
COLDLY</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Phil withdrew in some confusion, anger and
mortification struggling within him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a child in that man&#8217;s hands,&#8221; he
cried, as he re&euml;ntered his own room.
&#8220;Syd, he awakes in me all the instincts of
a brute. I can hardly keep my hands off
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let any one on board hear you
express such sentiments,&#8221; Sydney continued
gravely. &#8220;You must guard your tongue if
you are to fight him successfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>At evening &#8220;quarters&#8221; Phil saw Lazar in
conversation with Captain Taylor, on the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>As he passed them he overheard, from
Lazar&#8217;s lips, words that made his face flush
with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel I can never trust him again, sir;
his work has been very unsatisfactory from
the beginning. I desire to have him relieved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that is the reward for my hard work,&#8221;
thought Phil, despairingly.</p>

<p>After quarters he hesitated whether to go
and tell the captain all the circumstances and
endeavor to save his good name, or let matters
take their course. He felt that Lazar did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
not believe that he was the cause of the damage,
he only used it as a weapon against him.
But how would the captain act? Would he
demand an explanation?</p>

<p>These reflections were cut short by an
orderly at his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Penfield wishes to see you, sir,&#8221; announced
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, the captain has directed your
assignment in his office,&#8221; the executive officer
explained, as Phil saluted him a moment
later. &#8220;Your duty in the turret will be taken
by Mr. Marshall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil saluted and turned away. What did
it mean? The captain surely did not believe
him guilty of the act he was accused of by
Lazar, else he would not place him in such a
responsible position. He felt he had been
removed from the turret under a cloud, yet
his promotion to the office as secretary and
assistant to his commanding officer took out
most of the sting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil, you can dismiss it from your mind,&#8221;
Sydney told him after he had given him the
good news. &#8220;Lazar has played his trump
card, but he has not moved the captain. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
likes you, and of those we like it is hard to
believe evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face beamed with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, I count myself, indeed, fortunate to
have two such friends, you and Captain
Taylor,&#8221; he answered, lowering his voice to
hide his feelings.</p>

<p>In two days more target practice was ended
and the fleet once again anchored at its base
under the protecting wing of Cape Cod.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s new duties kept his mind from
brooding over his troubles with Lazar and
opened up to him a new side of ship life.</p>

<p>All official papers now passed through his
hands and the lad found himself in very intimate
relations with his revered captain.</p>

<p>It seemed to him, sometimes, that there
were some of his shipmates who were less
friendly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be my imagination,&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;I have not been entirely honest and my
conscience feels guilty for concealing my
secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the midst of these thoughts, the wireless
operator brought him a message, just received
from the flag-ship.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>He glanced casually at the bit of pink paper,
then his eyes opened wide with excitement
as he read the words of the message.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prepare your ship immediately for sea.
Destination La Boca, Verazala, South America.
Revolution in progress. Your confidential
orders are being prepared and will be sent over
directly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hastily entering the cabin, he placed the
message in his chief&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>The captain read slowly, and then rang the
bell for his orderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show this to Mr. Penfield,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;Tell him to make all arrangements.
We shall sail inside of four hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil marveled at the cool manner in which
the captain had received these sudden orders.</p>

<p>After forty years&#8217; service, he would understand
that such orders as these were too frequent
in the course of a navy man&#8217;s life to
cause more than passing surprise. Captain
Taylor had received orders as suddenly to go
around the world. Why should he show surprise
at a small matter of a couple of thousand
miles.</p>

<p>Phil took an important part in the preparations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
for carrying out these sudden orders.
Inside the allotted time all was ready. The
written orders and instructions were sealed in
the captain&#8217;s desk, ready to be opened and
studied at leisure on the way south.</p>

<p>While the &#8220;Connecticut&#8221; steamed past her
seven mates, the marines and band were
drawn up on each to salute her as she sailed
by, officers and men waving good-byes to
friends. Phil&#8217;s pulse beat faster.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a great life, Syd,&#8221; he cried joyously
to his companion standing by him on the
quarter-deck. &#8220;Who of us thought ten hours
ago that this evening would see us bound for
South America.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning Captain Taylor and Mr.
Penfield sat at the cabin table, reading and
discussing the import of the lengthy written
instructions from the Navy Department and
admiral.</p>

<p>Phil stood by, pencil and paper in hand,
ready to write down the plan these experienced
officers were about to draw up.</p>

<p>Each of the high-ranking officers read the
letters carefully, weighing every word. Then
Mr. Penfield waited for his superior to speak.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;This promises to be a very delicate business,
Penfield,&#8221; the captain commenced.
&#8220;The insurgents are said not to be very strong
at present, but it seems they are receiving arms
from the United States, which has greatly embarrassed
our relations with the government
of the republic. Official telegrams from the
minister, our representative, report the insurgents
a lawless band led by an outlaw called
Ruiz. The minister fears if the city should
be captured much valuable foreign and American
property will be destroyed by the rebels,
who cannot control their soldiers. This state
of affairs may involve our country seriously.
In upholding the Monroe Doctrine it will
insist on a policy of non-interference by
foreign governments, but where neutral property
is destroyed, due to the weakness of the
government of Verazala to control these internal
disorders, restitution to the injured must
be guaranteed by our government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can read in the tone of the letter,&#8221; said
Mr. Penfield, speaking slowly and deliberately,
&#8220;a purpose to uphold the government through
this rebellion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Captain Taylor, &#8220;our policy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
has always been, in dealing with these rebellions,
to uphold the government. If the
rebels win the upheaval is very disastrous to
our moneyed interests and harmful to our
friendly relations with the citizens of the republic.
Our country believes, and justly, that
it is a crime to change the government through
bloodshed, and has ever counseled the honest
use of the ballot-box to obtain the most popular
candidate for president. But, as this system
of suffrage does not appeal to the people
here, who place the military before all else, it
is our duty to do what is in our power to assure
the defeat of this rascal Ruiz; but we
must do it so cleverly that the insurgents will
never know that our government was unfriendly
to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what is your plan, sir?&#8221; asked Mr.
Penfield, much mystified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our government,&#8221; answered the captain,
decidedly, &#8220;having taken the side of the present
government of the republic, it is our purpose
to see that the rebels receive no aid from
the outside world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not mean that we shall actually
aid the government?&#8221; asked Mr. Penfield.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
&#8220;Our letter there,&#8221; pointing to the mass of
correspondence on the table, &#8220;enjoins the
strictest neutrality.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;not aid them openly,
but shut our eye to what they do, and seek
diligently for this leak by which the rebels
are receiving arms from our country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Mr. Perry?&#8221; the captain added,
surprising a look on the lad&#8217;s face that told he
had a question he would gladly ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to volunteer to find out from
where the arms come, sir,&#8221; he replied eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you will,&#8221; agreed the captain, smiling
at the enthusiastic boy. &#8220;I shall depend
upon you young men to ferret this out and
stop up the hole through which this aid
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s hand trembled with excitement as it
took down the plan devised by the captain
and his executive officer. It included a
guard for the legations, the home of the minister,
and all foreign property of value. Lazar,
on account of his linguistic attainments, was
to have charge, and Marshall and Morrison
were to be his assistants. Phil was to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the &#8220;Vidette,&#8221; a large sixty foot steamer, at
his disposal, and Sydney was to accompany
him.</p>

<p>Bristling with his important news, he found
his roommate in their room, hard at work
brushing up his Spanish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work, Syd,&#8221; Phil cried, glancing at
the book in Sydney&#8217;s hand; &#8220;we are both going
to have lots of practice with that tongue;&#8221;
and then he recited to him the news.</p>

<p>Sydney was delighted and showed it by
pounding his roommate over the back with
his book; then he flung it on the bunk and
opened a drawer, disclosing two handsomely
mounted Colt revolvers.</p>

<p>&#8220;My graduation present from dad,&#8221; he replied
to the questioning glance; &#8220;aren&#8217;t they
beauties? I am going to give you one; they
are so much handier than our large navy revolvers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think of receiving one,&#8221; Phil
replied gratefully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we need
to carry arms at all, and if we do, it would be
wiser to carry them openly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall insist, Phil,&#8221; urged Sydney. &#8220;Give
it back when you have no further use for it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
But you must see there may be times, in
secret work, where we might wish to be considered
unarmed civilians, and in a country
in the throes of revolution, it&#8217;s much safer to
have one of these little persuaders handy.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>SECRET SERVICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> days of steady steaming brought the
&#8220;Connecticut&#8221; within the tropics.</p>

<p>The sea was as peaceful as the waters of a
lake and the sun overhead shone down with
pitiless severity.</p>

<p>&#8220;All hands&#8221; were now dressed in white uniforms,
which made them comfortable enough
on deck under the cool shade of an awning,
but below decks the heat from the engines
and boilers was stifling.</p>

<p>The two friends spent most of their leisure
hours in the open air and at night rolled
themselves in their blankets on the clean
white deck.</p>

<p>One evening they had made themselves
comfortable for the night and were both speculating
upon what was in store for them in the
land of turmoil to which they were journeying.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Did you notice the sailorman,&#8221; asked
Sydney, &#8220;who has been walking past here as
if he were trying to find out who we are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t notice,&#8221; replied Phil sleepily;
&#8220;it&#8217;s probably one of the messengers searching
for some officer who is avoiding the heat
as we are doing by sleeping on deck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; Sydney answered, &#8220;but it appeared
to me he scrutinized us very closely,
although he must have seen immediately who
we were. That light behind us makes us
plainly visible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are accustomed to the darkness,&#8221; answered
Phil, with a yawn, &#8220;while he has probably
just come out of the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney was not at all satisfied with the explanation
and would have continued the argument,
but Phil&#8217;s even breathing showed his
companion was perfectly satisfied with the
solution.</p>

<p>They had been asleep but a short time
when one of the heavy tropical rain-storms,
which seem to be ever present on the horizon
in these waters, burst upon the ship, surprising
the boys, who had not noticed the gathering
clouds earlier in the night. They saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
with regret that they must seek other shelter
or else sleep the remainder of the night below
in their heated stateroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going below, Syd. I am sleepy
enough to sleep even in the heat,&#8221; said Phil,
gathering his bedding and disappearing down
the hatchway.</p>

<p>He groped his way across the dark passageway,
sleepily feeling for the door of his stateroom.</p>

<p>Suddenly he collided heavily with a figure
which sent him reeling across the deck. His
hand struck the side of the bulkhead and he
saved himself a fall.</p>

<p>In the dark he could just distinguish a
white figure as it dashed through the door
of the mess room and disappeared under the
multitude of sleeping-hammocks on the
berth deck.</p>

<p>What could it mean? What was this man
doing in his room?</p>

<p>Sydney came in after Phil had turned on
the light and was told of the experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;See if any of your valuables are missing?&#8221;
he suggested. &#8220;Mine are here on the
bureau all in plain sight.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Phil had been rummaging through his desk.
He now turned a smiling face to Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were right, Syd,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;the
locket is gone. He did risk detection to gain
possession of it. But it doesn&#8217;t matter, I can
never forget the girl&#8217;s face. I have looked at
it a hundred times in the last few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man of the locket and the fellow
who was watching us on deck are one and the
same,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed, proud of his perception.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably so,&#8221; answered Phil, &#8220;but that
doesn&#8217;t help us; he was clever enough not to
be recognized.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys, in spite of the incident, soon fell
asleep, and when they awakened the &#8220;Connecticut&#8221;
had anchored inside the break-water
at La Boca.</p>

<p>It was but a short time after sunrise when
they stood together at the rail gazing intently
on their surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is South America,&#8221; said Sydney
finally; &#8220;it looks just like any other country,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but there is a difference,&#8221; answered
Phil, meditatively; &#8220;for instance, see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
native boatman sculling along as if he had a
week to reach his destination; then look over
there at the coal pile on the mole. There are
nearly enough men to actually eat the coal,
yet they are not doing as much work as ten
good Americans. We are in the land of
&#8216;Ma&ntilde;ana&#8217; (to-morrow). No one wishes to
work too hard to-day, for he wishes to save
enough to do to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not the first nation to send a war-ship
here, I see,&#8221; said Captain Taylor, joining
the boys in their study of the harbor.
&#8220;There is a German cruiser over yonder and a
Frenchman is anchored just astern of us, and
our wireless operator has been in communication
with a British ship for some hours. She
is on her way from Barbadoes. It seems we
are to have an interesting time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was impatient to ask the captain when
their work would commence, but he desisted.
It were better the captain should broach the
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you lads have the &#8216;lingo&#8217; at your
tongue&#8217;s tip,&#8221; the captain remarked smilingly.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t find much English spoken here,
and a little Spanish is a necessity.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; they both agreed.</p>

<p>Phil could not contain himself longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;When can we start on our work, sir?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such zeal I have never seen before,&#8221; answered
the captain, a merry twinkle in his
eyes. &#8220;Soon enough, lad,&#8221; he added gravely.
&#8220;I hope nothing happens to you youngsters.
I almost fear I am wrong in not sending
older and maybe wiser heads to do this
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir,&#8221; Phil and Sydney cried together;
then Phil added, &#8220;We are old enough,
sir; we are nearly twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly twenty,&#8221; roared the skipper in
merriment. &#8220;You are both mere infants in
the wicked ways of these people here, but it
will be an excellent lesson for you. When I
was your age,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it was during the
Civil War, many times I did work that in
these days of peace never comes to men of
your age.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain left them to receive the foreign
officers who were coming alongside to pay the
customary visit of courtesy to a senior commanding
officer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>Some hours later Phil and Sydney received
orders to prepare themselves to accompany
Captain Taylor ashore to pay his respects to
the United States Minister to Verazala.</p>

<p>As they left the ship in the speedy &#8220;Vidette,&#8221;
our lads felt that a new and interesting life
was opening before them. Were they not to
have a hand in the affairs of their great nation?</p>

<p>They found the minister&#8217;s carriage awaiting
them at the landing, and were driven rapidly
amid staring crowds of natives through the
narrow streets of the city.</p>

<p>The carriage drew up at a large house on a
hill overlooking the harbor. The coat of arms,
emblazoned on the door, was enough evidence
that inside was the inviolable territory of the
United States of America.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, captain,&#8221; cried the Honorable Robert
Henderson, as he grasped the hands of the
three officers in turn, &#8220;your fine ship carrying
that grand old flag was a welcome sight
when we awoke this morning. A great weight
has been lifted from my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We came down at full speed, sir,&#8221; replied
Captain Taylor, courteously, &#8220;and now we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
at your service, every man of us. You have
but to command me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old diplomat swallowed a lump in his
throat before replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Taylor, you cannot imagine the
delight it gives us exiles to feel that we have
so many brave American hearts so near at
hand. I pray there will be no need to resort
to force, but affairs appear to be more serious
than I should wish. The rebel army is but a
league from the city, and awaits an opportunity
to attack. Their leader, General Ruiz, is a
cutthroat and unfit for the high office of
president of the republic. My most trustworthy
informant tells me the rebels are losing
strength daily and so I have informed the
State Department, but affairs lately have led
me to believe that their strength has been underestimated.
I should greatly deplore the
city being taken by these brigands, for I fear
much valuable property will be destroyed by
their undisciplined followers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems nothing for us to do, save
await developments?&#8221; asked the captain, having
followed closely the minister&#8217;s explanation
of the situation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;No, there is nothing,&#8221; he answered promptly.
&#8220;I have a faithful vice-consul, who keeps me
well informed of the movements on both sides.
He is a naturalized American citizen. His
name is Isidro Juarez. He has lived here
many years and seems to have friends in both
armies. I trust him implicitly. I shall keep
you daily informed so that we may act
promptly in an emergency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the minister know that arms for the
insurgents are coming from the United States?&#8221;
asked Phil of the captain as they drove back
to the boat landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He made no mention of it,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;If his information is really trustworthy, he
must know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>On arriving on board ship, Phil was called
upon to make a boarding call to the American
mail steamer, just arrived from New York.</p>

<p>Buckling on his sword, the badge of official
duty, he descended the gangway. As he was
about to step into the &#8220;Vidette&#8221; alongside, he
glanced up and saw O&#8217;Neil was at the helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he cried with pleasure, &#8220;so you
have had a promotion too; I am mighty glad
to see you in my boat. This is going to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
my boat while here,&#8221; he confided in a lower
tone, &#8220;and I know of no one whom I would
rather have than you, O&#8217;Neil.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coxswain beamed with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he answered
abashed. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great honor you are paying
me, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>After getting alongside the anchored merchantman,
Phil mounted the gangway ladder
to the main deck.</p>

<p>There he was received cordially by her
captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to be acquainted with you,&#8221; he said,
shaking the lad&#8217;s hand. &#8220;It does me good
to see our fine big ships in foreign ports.
These dagos here are a hundred per cent.
more civil already.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way to his cabin and gave Phil
the information which the custom of the
naval service requires be obtained upon visiting
American merchantmen in foreign ports.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you cannot be of any assistance to
me,&#8221; answered the captain to Phil&#8217;s inquiry;
&#8220;but it&#8217;s great to see her over there. Why, she
could blow this whole town into pieces in a
half hour, and she would, too, if it were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
necessary, wouldn&#8217;t she?&#8221; the captain interrogated,
warmed to his theme.</p>

<p>A uniformed official appeared at this
moment to speak to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Baldwin. This is a young
officer from the battle-ship,&#8221; the captain announced;
&#8220;Mr. Baldwin is our purser.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The legation steam launch is alongside
for the minister&#8217;s freight,&#8221; the purser reported.
&#8220;Mr. Juarez is in her to sign the receipts for
the bills of lading. Shall I deliver it at once?
There are about twenty heavy packages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Baldwin, go right ahead,&#8221; replied
the captain. Then turning to Phil, as the
purser withdrew: &#8220;A diplomatic officer has
a privilege which no one else has; his freight
can be landed direct; everything else must
go through the custom-house ashore and be
inspected.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain excused himself shortly but
insisted that Phil should make himself at
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a look about the ship,&#8221; he said
proudly; &#8220;she&#8217;s not as big as yours yonder,
but she is a stanch one for this trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was glad to have an excuse to remain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
He had heard something to arouse his
curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have a look at this Juarez and his
boxes,&#8221; he mused as he followed the captain
on deck.</p>

<p>Stepping to the high rail, he glanced down
on a large launch, lying alongside the ship
abreast her forward cargo hatch. Big boxes
were being hoisted out of the hold by the
ship&#8217;s derrick and landed on the smaller vessel&#8217;s
deck. Phil saw a short heavily built
man, dressed in white clothes, with a wide
brimmed panama set over a massive head. He
was superintending the landing of the boxes.</p>

<p>This man Phil knew must be Juarez, the
minister&#8217;s confidential vice-consul.</p>

<p>Phil descended to the lower deck in order
to be nearer the work of landing the cargo.
He also wanted to have a better look at this man.</p>

<p>He found a convenient air port not ten feet
from the launch, where he could see unobserved
by those on board it.</p>

<p>There were a number of very heavy packages
and the small natives on the deck of
the launch strained and pulled to find deck
space for them all.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_098.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>HE FOUND A CONVENIENT<br />
AIR PORT</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Phil saw a small native fishing-boat, her
sail flapping idly in the gentle breeze, move
slowly and with deliberation over the tranquil
water, edging in toward the launch.</p>

<p>The vice-consul seemed not to observe it,
but Phil saw the eagerness on the fisherman&#8217;s
face. He watched the scene with rising
pulse.</p>

<p>The boat drifted foot by foot to within ten
feet of the launch.</p>

<p>Juarez busied himself at the strap of a large
box in the stern of the launch nearest the
fisherman.</p>

<p>Phil saw the fisherman make a swift move
with his hand, and saw a white object fall on
the launch&#8217;s deck at Juarez&#8217;s feet. Juarez
lifted one foot carelessly and placed it fairly
on the object.</p>

<p>The fisherman put his helm over and
hauled taut his sheet. The sails quickly
filled and the boat glided swiftly toward the
harbor&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>Juarez stooped down and rising, thrust his
hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>Phil felt every nerve thrill. His secret
service had begun under a lucky star.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Returning</span> to the &#8220;Connecticut,&#8221; Phil told
his remarkable experiences to Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil, I believe we have blundered upon
the way in which these insurgents are receiving
their arms,&#8221; he replied excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; answered Phil; &#8220;and
to think that our good minister&#8217;s name is
being used in such a way. We must intercept
these boxes before they reach their
destination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing is certain,&#8221; Sydney insisted;
&#8220;the minister&#8217;s name will be removed from
the boxes before they are sent to the insurgents.
Juarez is too clever to allow himself
to be discovered in this risky undertaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; agreed Phil, &#8220;and that
means Juarez will land the boxes on shore
here and remove all marks of identification.
Come, we must find where the minister&#8217;s
launch will land and try to discover when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
they will attempt to smuggle the arms to the
insurgents. It will be by water, surely, for
he wouldn&#8217;t dare attempt to pass through
the lines of the loyal army with his bulky
packages.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having received the required permission,
the lads landed again on the great iron pier
of La Boca.</p>

<p>They were both dressed in civilians&#8217; clothes,
but in this town of so few strangers, they
were recognized immediately as coming from
one of the men-of-war in port.</p>

<p>They walked up the water front, examining
each wharf as they passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is, Syd,&#8221; cried Phil, grasping
his friend&#8217;s arm and pointing to a good-sized
black launch tied up to a long dock running
out into the bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful,&#8221; Sydney cautioned; &#8220;don&#8217;t destroy
our usefulness by being too much interested.
There may be unfriendly eyes looking
at us this very minute. Let&#8217;s stroll down and
see what she is doing there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys sauntered down the wharf. They
saw that the boxes had been removed from
the launch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;Those boxes are inside that warehouse,&#8221;
announced Sydney, indicating a door abreast
the launch. The warehouse was a long one,
built on the jutting dock.</p>

<p>&#8220;La Fitte and Company,&#8221; murmured Phil,
reading the name in large gilt letters over
the door of the warehouse. &#8220;Where have I
heard of that firm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s the firm,&#8221; cried Sydney, surprisedly,
&#8220;that has been trying to get the
concession of the Pitch Lakes away from the
American Syndicate. I begin to see a reason
for Juarez&#8217;s intrigue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; returned Phil, who
had not followed Sydney&#8217;s thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly clear,&#8221; said Sydney, convincedly.
&#8220;La Fitte and Company are composed
of foreigners, mostly Frenchmen; they
have engaged Juarez to do the work of prejudicing
the insurgents against Americans. If
this rascal succeeds and the insurgents gain
the reins of government, the concession will
be taken from the American Syndicate and
given to La Fitte and Company. This
concession right is a very valuable one,
worth many millions of dollars a year to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
those who are lucky enough to obtain
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, you are a wonder,&#8221; cried Phil, admiringly.
&#8220;Come, we have no more business
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned about and walked past the
unloaded launch.</p>

<p>The vice-consul, who had been inside the
warehouse, came to the door as our lads passed.</p>

<p>He glanced at them, a startled look on his
face, then he smilingly raised his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; he greeted in English,
with a marked foreign accent. &#8220;You are off
the &#8216;Connecticut,&#8217; no? We are delighted to
see our flag on such a fine large ship. If I
can be of the slightest service I shall be highly
honored,&#8221; he added in the suave tones of a
Spanish grandee.</p>

<p>Our boys stopped and returned his greeting,
thanking him for his considerate offer.
Then they continued their walk.</p>

<p>Phil looked over his shoulder and surprised
a sinister expression on Juarez&#8217;s face, before
he could hide it in a smile of parting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that fellow saw us; he may suspect
that we know something of his secret,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
confided Phil, as he and Sydney regained the
street of the water front.</p>

<p>They had been on board their ship but a
short while when the minister&#8217;s launch, with
his flag flying in the bow, was reported heading
for the &#8220;Connecticut.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marine guard and the band were
quickly paraded on the quarter-deck and the
officers, headed by Captain Taylor, all in full
uniform, were at the gangway to do honor to
the high American official.</p>

<p>The vice-consul accompanied the minister,
and as he followed his chief through the formality
of hand-shaking, Phil saw him grasp
Lazar&#8217;s hand cordially and tell him in Spanish
how glad he was to see him again.</p>

<p>Lazar smiled in his cold way, but Phil
thought the ensign did not seem overjoyed to
renew the acquaintance.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Lazar has known this scoundrel before,&#8221;
thought Phil. &#8220;I wonder how much
he knows of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought was answered soon enough,
and in a way that showed Lazar in his true
character.</p>

<p>Phil had gone below to his room and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
writing his weekly letter home, which of late
his new and eventful life had caused him to
neglect.</p>

<p>He was seated at his desk under the ventilator
shaft, which brought fresh air from above.
It opened into one of the numerous ventilator-cowls
on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>He could hear indistinctly above him the
voices of two men, pacing the quarter-deck,
but they did not disturb him until they
stopped directly over his ventilator shaft, and
he recognized at once the voices of Lazar and
the vice-consul.</p>

<p>&#8220;So your precious conscience hurts you,
does it?&#8221; the vice-consul was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of that,&#8221; Lazar&#8217;s voice
answered, &#8220;and you know it, Juarez. But
smuggling is too risky. I had a narrow escape
from detection in New York a year ago,
getting your goods ashore, and I don&#8217;t wish to
go through that worry again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You made a handsome sum out of it,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Juarez&#8217;s voice questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so loud,&#8221; Lazar cautioned, &#8220;it&#8217;s too
dangerous; if this were known, I&#8217;d lose my
commission.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;You are losing your nerve, Lazar,&#8221; the vice-consul&#8217;s
voice sneered; &#8220;there is no one about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell, and anyway, this is not the
place to discuss such matters,&#8221; Lazar said decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please, but, by the way, I might
as well tell you; I know you dare not betray
me,&#8221; the vice-consul&#8217;s voice said menacingly,
&#8220;and I need your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speakers changed their positions
slightly and their voices failed to carry distinctly
to the eager eavesdropper.</p>

<p>Phil trembled with expectancy at the startling
intelligence he had received.</p>

<p>So Lazar had been tempted to do something
for which his commission would be forfeited if
found out. What a terrible weapon to hold
over his enemy if he continued his persecution.
What was the secret Juarez had confided
to Lazar? The arms surely.</p>

<p>The voices had now died out entirely, and
a shuffling of feet on deck told Phil that the
minister was ready to leave the ship.</p>

<p>He told Sydney all he had heard as soon as
they had returned to their room after the departure
of the American minister.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;I am not surprised,&#8221; exclaimed Sydney,
when Phil had finished his story. &#8220;Lazar is
capable of anything evil. We have another
person to reckon with, however, in this arms
smuggling. If he suspects we are attempting
to intercept them, Lazar will, in hatred of
you, try to defeat your plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better confide in Captain
Taylor?&#8221; questioned Phil. &#8220;We can thus cut
Lazar&#8217;s claws.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should not do that until we can prove
our story fully,&#8221; answered Sydney. &#8220;The
captain might believe our accusations were
true, but he could hardly act officially upon
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems hard that such a scoundrel
should wear an officer&#8217;s uniform,&#8221; protested
the lad, &#8220;but I dare say you are right, Syd.
We must seek for more convincing evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your plan for to-night?&#8221; asked
Sydney, as he took his revolvers out of their
case and examined them critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have decided to keep a watch during
the day, and if no vessel large enough to
carry the boxes leaves port before dark, then
to lie in wait in the &#8216;Vidette&#8217; at the entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
of the harbor, and overhaul any suspicious
craft that comes out of port.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; agreed Sydney. &#8220;I am quite
confident that Juarez will use a steamer; the
breeze is too light, and as he must go nearly
twenty miles by water to reach the insurgent
lines, a sailing vessel would be out of the
question. The note you saw thrown by the
native boatman undoubtedly set a rendezvous
for this evening. They will want to get
the arms to the insurgents as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney made their preparations
quietly. O&#8217;Neil was called and told something
of what was going forward and ordered
to keep his launch, the &#8220;Vidette,&#8221; in readiness.</p>

<p>All afternoon the lads spent on deck, casting
anxious glances toward the dock where
the minister&#8217;s launch was tied. There were a
number of other launches moving about the
harbor, but there was only one other large
enough to carry the boxes.</p>

<p>About 7 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, the sun having set a half hour
before, it was dark enough to start, and
they appeared on deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have the captain&#8217;s permission to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
the &#8216;Vidette,&#8217;&#8221; Phil reported to the officer
of the deck. &#8220;I have reported to Mr. Penfield.
Will you have her called away, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Phil peered through the darkness,
the deck lights not being lighted as yet, and
saw Lazar was the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;What could he do to prevent our going?&#8221;
thought Phil nervously. &#8220;Nothing, he would
not dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; Lazar answered carelessly,
and then he ordered the bugler to &#8220;call the
&#8216;Vidette&#8217; away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes dragged by, and still the
&#8220;Vidette&#8221; hung at the lower boom, motionless
in the water.</p>

<p>A launch steamed by the battle-ship at fair
speed, standing out of the harbor. Phil and
Sydney strained their eyes in an endeavor to
discover its identity, but the night was too
dark and it was soon lost sight of in the
distance.</p>

<p>Phil felt sure it was the cargo of arms. He
could suppress his impatience no longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lazar,&#8221; he spoke abruptly, &#8220;may I
go and find out what is holding the
&#8216;Vidette&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>&#8220;No, sir, I shall find out in plenty of
time,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;You young gentlemen
seem to be in great haste.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally he hailed the &#8220;Vidette&#8221; and inquired
what was the trouble.</p>

<p>An answer came back in O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t get any water in the boiler; the
feed pump is jammed, sir,&#8221; he cried, in exasperation.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart sank. There was the prize
slipping away before their very eyes. He
knew that this must be Lazar&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Turning quickly he rushed to the cabin
and unannounced burst in upon the commanding
officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one has deliberately disabled the
&#8216;Vidette,&#8217;&#8221; he cried excitedly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell
you why now, but believe me, sir, it is very
important for us to get away at once. I
asked the officer of the deck, Mr. Lazar, for
permission to go down into the boat, but he
refuses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain glanced up startled, a look of
annoyance on his face. Then he realized that
the lad was in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>Picking up his cap he led the way on deck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;Mr. Lazar,&#8221; he ordered sternly, &#8220;allow
these two young gentlemen to go down into
the &#8216;Vidette&#8217; immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lazar hesitated but an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir. If you say so,&#8221; he answered
with a wave of the hand to the waiting
lads.</p>

<p>The two boys scrambled hastily down the
Jacob&#8217;s ladder from the lower boom on to the
deck of the &#8220;Vidette.&#8221; Phil made his way
to the machinery space.</p>

<p>The engineer and fireman were bending
over the little feed pump, which supplied the
boiler with water.</p>

<p>Phil glanced at the gauge glass; there was
no water showing. He tried the test-cocks,
then looked quickly at the steam
gauge.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boiler is half full of water, but there
is only fifty pounds pressure, and the fires are
hauled,&#8221; he cried angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put back your fire,&#8221; he shouted to the fireman,
pushing him fiercely toward the furnace,
then he started in himself to get the feed pump
running.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil stood by petrified with astonishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
at the way he pitched into the intricacies
of the machinery.</p>

<p>&#8220;The engineer&#8217;s a new one, sir,&#8221; he whispered
to Phil. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he knows
much about this kind of engine. The officer
of the deck took our regular engineer out and
put this man in about an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had been too much occupied trying to
find the trouble to grasp the meaning of the
coxswain&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>He followed up each pipe and made every
test he had been taught at Annapolis to use
in finding the trouble with these machines.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are beaten,&#8221; he cried despondently to
Sydney, at his wit&#8217;s end.</p>

<p>The minutes flew by.</p>

<p>Then he gave a shout of joy, as he saw a
tiny steel wedge jammed in between the moving
parts of the pump.</p>

<p>A tap with a hammer and the pump
started up, pumping precious water into the
boiler.</p>

<p>In but a few minutes more the &#8220;Vidette&#8221;
had cast off her line and was steaming with
ever increasing speed toward the entrance to
the harbor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Both lads scanned the horizon to seaward.
There was nothing in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like looking for a needle in a haystack,&#8221;
Phil exclaimed dejectedly. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
even know which way they turned when they
reached the entrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begging your pardon, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil interrupted
earnestly, &#8220;there ain&#8217;t but one place
for her to go, and that is to Mariel. I ran on
a line of coasting steamers once and I know
somewhat of the water about here. There
ain&#8217;t no place to land the other way for fifty
miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil, you are a trump,&#8221; cried Phil, much
relieved. &#8220;We may catch her yet; she has
over a half hour&#8217;s start, but we have four
knots better speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reaching the harbor mouth, O&#8217;Neil put his
helm hard astarboard and headed the &#8220;Vidette&#8221;
to the westward along the coast line.</p>

<p>&#8220;How close to shore can we run?&#8221; asked
Sydney, addressing the coxswain.</p>

<p>&#8220;After we round the next point of land,
sir, as close as you please,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged heavily along. The
point was reached and rounded, then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
&#8220;Vidette&#8221; was headed to close with the shore
line.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that on the bow there?&#8221; Phil
asked anxiously, pointing to a dark shadow
on the dimly lighted water.</p>

<p>There was not a doubt but that it was the
prize scudding along. Great volumes of smoke
poured from her stack. The smoke had betrayed
her presence. She was too distant for
her hull to be visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your course,&#8221; cried Phil joyously.
&#8220;We can head her off on this line.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney took from his pockets his Colt revolvers
and laid them beside the big navy
Colts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you the rifles, O&#8217;Neil?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I have, sir, and a hundred rounds
of ammunition for each one,&#8221; replied the
faithful man; &#8220;and me and Johnson there
know how to use them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I trust it won&#8217;t be necessary,&#8221; said
Phil immensely pleased, &#8220;but it&#8217;s better to be
sure than sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Vidette&#8221; drew up slowly on the fleeing
launch.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are surely making for Mariel,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
O&#8217;Neil announced, &#8220;and we can catch them
before they reach there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of a sudden the engines, which had
been running perfectly, suddenly seemed to
slow.</p>

<p>Phil was on his feet in an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>The engineer looked up, showing a white,
scared face in the dim light of the solitary
lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Running a little hot, sir,&#8221; he replied
haltingly.</p>

<p>Phil felt the moving parts. They were
cool. He looked up in surprise at the
engineer and saw him put his hand quickly
in his shirt.</p>

<p>Impulsively he grabbed the man by the
wrist and held his hand to the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sand!&#8221; he cried in anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get this man out of here, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he suddenly
ordered, forcibly pushing him from the
engines and taking the man&#8217;s place at the
throttle.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of your monkeying now,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
assured the engineer. &#8220;You&#8217;ve given enough
trouble already.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>The engine bearings were thoroughly oiled
and the throttle opened wide. Fortunately,
Phil had detected the man in time, for if he
had succeeded in getting the smallest quantity
of sand in the bearings, the engines must
have stopped.</p>

<p>The fleeing launch was now in plain sight,
but the landing at Mariel was but a half mile
away. He did not dare open fire on her.
Would he dare attempt to cut her out under
the eyes of the insurgents waiting their expected
guns?</p>

<p>&#8220;Launch ahoy!&#8221; Phil hailed in Spanish.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>He hailed again and added: &#8220;I want to
speak to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>From outward appearances, there was no
one on the launch, but black smoke poured
from her funnel and her white wake showed
she was making a final spurt.</p>

<p>The bow of the &#8220;Vidette&#8221; was now inside
and abreast of the launch&#8217;s quarter. It slowly
moved forward. There was scarce ten feet of
open water between the two boats.</p>

<p>With weapons in hand Phil and his men
waited.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;Put her alongside,&#8221; Phil ordered, striving
to control the nervousness in his voice.</p>

<p>The two launches came together, with
scarcely a jar, and steamed along as one boat.</p>

<p>No one moved on the prize.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil instinctively had swung his bow
around and headed the boats out from the
land now only a few hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>Phil saw there were four men on the boat,
but his eyes fell with pleasure on the boxes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you surrender?&#8221; Phil shouted fiercely
to the man at the wheel, only five feet away
from him.</p>

<p>The man glanced in terror at the pistol
pointing at his head, in the hands of a gringo,
one of those whom he had been told could hit
a peso at a distance of a hundred metres.</p>

<p>&#8220;Si, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; he answered tremblingly.</p>

<p>As the two boats headed away, the whole
shore line near them burst into flame, and
the hiss of countless bullets sang warningly
about them. Suddenly the suspected engineer
threw up his hands and dropped to the deck.</p>

<small>PRISONERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O&#8217;Neil</span> stuck manfully at his post, the bullets
showering around him as he stood exposed
at the tiller.</p>

<p>Phil breathed more easily as the two
launches, now secured together, put sufficient
distance between them and the unfriendly
shore.</p>

<p>The coxswain&#8217;s voice, raised anxiously,
caused our lad fresh alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear he&#8217;s hit badly, sir,&#8221; he deplored, as
he raised a limp figure from the bottom of
the launch.</p>

<p>Both boys were beside the wounded man in
an instant and quickly stripped him of his
blood-soaked clothing. In the light of a
bull&#8217;s-eye lantern, Phil examined the hole
made by an insurgent bullet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a flesh wound,&#8221; he breathed, immensely
relieved; &#8220;the bullet went through
the fleshy part of the breast. He is stunned,
the blow was so near his heart.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Some water, quick,&#8221; ordered Sydney,
while Phil bandaged the wounded man with
strips of his own shirt.</p>

<p>Water thrown on his face brought the man
back to consciousness.</p>

<p>Phil left Sydney to make the wounded
sailor comfortable, and followed by O&#8217;Neil,
boarded the prize.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not the minister&#8217;s boat; this one
has a deck house, while his boat is flush
decked,&#8221; he gasped in the greatest alarm.
&#8220;What have we done?&#8221; Then he flashed his
light over the cargo. &#8220;The boxes are the same,
I can swear to that, and, as I supposed, all
marks have been removed. These are unaddressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The frightened crew, imagining, no doubt,
they were in the hands of pirates, were speechless
from terror. Juarez was not on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;What launch is this?&#8221; demanded Phil, in
Spanish.</p>

<p>&#8220;La Fitte and Company&#8217;s, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; replied,
cringingly, the native padron.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you here?&#8221; Phil asked flourishing
his revolver menacingly, &#8220;and where
were you taking them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;They contain machinery, se&ntilde;or, for Se&ntilde;or
La Fitte&#8217;s plantation at Mariel,&#8221; replied the
native coxswain, gaining confidence, seeing
his life was not in such imminent danger.</p>

<p>Had they made a terrible mistake? Did
these boxes contain machinery only and no
arms? But why should they be sent addressed
to the United States Minister? Then the remembrance
of the hot fire, through which
they had just passed, dissipated all doubt.
They were surely contraband arms, but being
on board a launch which sailed under the flag
of the republic, the two lads were openly aiding
the government of the republic.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; Phil asked himself.
&#8220;I wish Captain Taylor were here; this situation
is too deep for me to solve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he thought with anxiety of the
wounded man, an evidence of their expedition
which could not be concealed.</p>

<p>He was glad when Sydney, who had been
attending the sailor, stood beside him on the
captured launch. He tersely explained to
him his discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not set them free,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed
immediately. &#8220;We have gone too far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
for that. You are confident that these same
boxes ten hours ago were marked for our minister,
and when we captured them they were
nearly in the hands of the insurgents. There
isn&#8217;t a doubt but that the boxes contain arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Picking up a hatchet lying on the deck of
the launch, Phil with a few swift strokes bared
the contents of the nearest box.</p>

<p>Both lads peered in anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colt automatic guns,&#8221; cried Phil, triumphantly.
&#8220;Why, this shipment is worth more
to the insurgents than ten thousand rifles.
The side which has these guns will win the
fight. There must be several batteries of them
packed in these cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>No longer in doubt, Phil ordered O&#8217;Neil to
tow the launch back to the harbor of La Boca.</p>

<p>They had been on the return but a short
time, when O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s voice disturbed the lads
deep in their own thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a launch heading this way, sir,&#8221;
he reported; &#8220;it looks like one of our steamers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was on his feet instantly peering through
the darkness ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahoy, there,&#8221; from the approaching
launch; &#8220;what launch is that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>&#8220;The &#8216;Vidette,&#8217; sir,&#8221; Phil answered, greatly
relieved. He recognized Captain Taylor&#8217;s
voice and ordered O&#8217;Neil to stop and &#8220;lay to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; the captain hailed
anxiously.</p>

<p>Phil hesitated an instant, then he thought
explanations could be made when he came on
board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>The steamer sheered up alongside the
&#8220;Vidette&#8221; and the captain stepped on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done?&#8221; he inquired in
alarm as he saw for the first time the launch
in tow. &#8220;I felt uneasy after you had gone and
followed you in one of the ship&#8217;s steamers. I
heard the firing a few minutes ago and then
sighted you coming back. What does it
mean?&#8221; He stopped breathlessly in amazement.</p>

<p>Phil was the first to speak. He quietly and
laconically outlined the incident from the
beginning, leaving out all that in any way
concerned Lazar.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, sir,&#8221; he said in conclusion, &#8220;I
am no longer in command. I am ready to
receive your orders, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Both lads saluted, and O&#8217;Neil seeing that
something was going forward raised his hand
also to his cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me!&#8221; cried the captain, glancing at
his piratical crew in the glimmer of the
swinging lantern. They did look desperate;
each of the three was plentifully sprinkled
with the blood of the wounded man and Phil
was bared to the waist, his shirt having gone
to make a first-aid bandage.</p>

<p>&#8220;What puzzled us,&#8221; began Phil, &#8220;is how
we are going to dispose of these arms. Of
course, we must set the launch free to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly so,&#8221; exclaimed the captain; &#8220;that
is the question&mdash;what to do with the arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t on board the ship be the safest
place?&#8221; questioned Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; returned the captain, &#8220;but
it wouldn&#8217;t do. I have it,&#8221; turning to Phil;
&#8220;you say you are positive these boxes came
on the steamer this morning addressed to our
minister; then we shall deliver them to him
at the legation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is our best course, surely,&#8221; Phil
agreed. &#8220;But might not the minister refuse
to receive them, fearing that they might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
coveted by both sides, and thus precipitate an
attack on the legation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There would be no danger of that happening,&#8221;
answered the captain, &#8220;for I shall
send a guard ashore with the boxes, to remain
at the legation. I had intended waiting until
affairs became more serious, but the contents
of these boxes furnishes me with sufficient
reason to act at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil rang up full speed and the &#8220;Vidette,&#8221;
with her prize in tow, was again steaming for
the entrance to the harbor.</p>

<p>Phil told the captain about the wounded
man, but refrained from mentioning his conduct
during the chase, and that kindly officer
insisted on speaking to the disabled sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, my man?&#8221; he questioned
sympathetically.</p>

<p>The engineer glanced up, showing a worried
face in the light of the oil lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joseph Craig, sir,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>The excitement of the recent incident had
passed away and Phil&#8217;s thoughts now dwelt
on the curious action of the engineer. Why
had he tried to detain the &#8220;Vidette&#8221;? What
interest could he have in the captured arms?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
He could arrive at but one conclusion: Joseph
Craig was a tool in the hands of Lazar.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Vidette&#8221; and her prize were soon
alongside the battle-ship, and the captain
stepped on board, followed by the two boys.</p>

<p>Lazar&#8217;s disappointed face gave them a taste
of real enjoyment, but the captain&#8217;s words
quickly turned the tables.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send word to Mr. Penfield,&#8221; he ordered,
addressing Lazar, &#8220;that I desire to send the
guard for the legation ashore immediately.
You will go in charge, with Midshipmen Marshall
and Morrison as your assistants. The
guard will consist of fifty men. They must
take tenting and rations. The boxes in that
black launch contain machine guns and were
destined for the insurgent army; these are to
be taken to the legation and your sole duty is
to guard them safely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had half started to speak as he saw
Lazar&#8217;s face light up with triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;he dare not deliver
up the guns. It would be worth his
commission at the very least. They are surely
safe in his hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Perry,&#8221; said the captain in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
kindly tones, turning from the officer of
the deck to the waiting midshipmen, &#8220;you
and Mr. Monroe go below and turn in. You
have worked hard enough for one day. Mr.
Lazar can attend to everything. Your service,
gentlemen, has been highly gratifying and a
credit to the best traditions of American
midshipmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads went reluctantly below to their
room, much chagrined at the course affairs
had taken. Their enemy and a paid emissary
of the vice-consul in charge of the arms
they had worked so hard to capture. It
was deeply disappointing, but they felt powerless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have interfered,&#8221; Phil argued
to himself as he lay in his bunk, &#8220;unless I
told the captain all, and what proof could
I have brought? Both Lazar and the vice-consul
would deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite their excited experiences, our boys
were soon wrapt in profound slumber.</p>

<p>They were awake early the next morning
and went about their routine duties on board
ship as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The wounded engineer was placed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
sick bay and the doctors announced he would
be ready for duty in a few days.</p>

<p>A rumor that something extraordinary had
happened passed about the ship, but the captain
cautioned the strictest secrecy, and gave
out that he had landed the guard to be ready
in case the expected assault on the city should
prove successful.</p>

<p>Phil, as he stood on the quarter-deck after
breakfast, could see the dozen or more khaki-colored
tents on Legation Hill, where Lazar&#8217;s
men were encamped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marshall and Morrison are there, I am
thankful to say,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Lazar will
have to reckon with two wide-awake men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; Captain Taylor said a few
moments later in his cabin, where Phil had
gone in answer to his summons, &#8220;I have
just received a message in cipher from the
Navy Department. It is of grave importance.
One which so closely concerns our government
that we must needs spare no effort to ascertain
the truth. The State Department
have reason to believe that affairs here are not
as represented by official despatches from the
minister. You have already unmasked one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
villain, and undoubtedly it was he who has
misled the minister in his estimates of the
strength of the insurgents. I do not think it
advisable at this time to report to Washington
the perfidy of Juarez. Our minister believes,
as I do, that as we have the arms it is better
to say nothing at present. Juarez of course
has deserted and may be in the insurgent
camp. Or, still more likely, he sailed in the
American steamer this morning for Panama.
We must have, as soon as possible, reliable information
as to the strength of the rebellion.
It is this intelligence that I wish you to get
from the insurgent camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil listened attentively to the captain&#8217;s
lengthy explanation and instructions. His
pulse beat fast. Here was an opportunity he
had longed for, dreamed of. It was now
really true. He was going to the camp of an
army. He would see war.</p>

<p>&#8220;The details I shall leave to you,&#8221; the captain
continued, smiling at the distinct delight
in the lad&#8217;s face. &#8220;Do not be too impetuous.
Remember it is hazardous work, and of such
a peculiar character that you may be deprived
of your right as a neutral. Mr. Monroe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
I am sure, will wish to go with you, and
I think you should have one other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May O&#8217;Neil go along, sir?&#8221; asked Phil, attempting
to conceal from the quiet captain his
boyish excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly,&#8221; assented the captain
amusedly. &#8220;You seem to like O&#8217;Neil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like him, sir,&#8221; cried he, in admiration,
&#8220;why he is the finest type of American sailorman
I have ever met.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you have so much discernment,&#8221;
the captain said smilingly; &#8220;it is rare at your
age. That is also my opinion of him.&#8221; He
reached down, and from his desk, took up a
sheet of oiled paper, with an engraving at the
top and the seal of the United States across its
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; he said generously, &#8220;that he
would rather have this at your hands than
mine. Give this to boatswain&#8217;s mate O&#8217;Neil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil ran from the cabin in joyful haste,
after thanking the captain as if he himself had
received the promotion.</p>

<p>He found O&#8217;Neil in his quarters and pressed
the paper upon him.</p>

<p>The new boatswain&#8217;s mate&#8217;s eyes opened wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
with surprise, and his face was flushed with
delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I congratulate you, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil cried.
&#8220;You deserve it, and more too.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s voice was husky with manly
emotion, as he thanked the young officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t forget your kindness,&#8221; he said
gratefully.</p>

<p>A few hours later three travelers passed
along the narrow streets of La Boca in the direction
of the suburbs. Each carried a small
bundle in one hand and a climbing stick in
the other. Their clothes were old and worn
as if their owners were accustomed to much
tramping over a rough country. They passed
without hindrance through the successive
lines of defense of the loyal army. Walking
Englishmen were frequent and their costumes
bore out the part.</p>

<p>Leaving the city behind them, they
traveled along the military road, running
parallel to the sea. Its sides were lined with
high tropical vegetation, with here and there
a hut nestling in a clearing, but all were
deserted. They were between the lines of
the two armies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>A quarter of a mile down the road a dark
object came into view, standing like an abandoned
wagon in the middle of the sun-baked
road-bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Artillery,&#8221; Phil cried; &#8220;now look out for
a challenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope they don&#8217;t shoot first and challenge
afterward, like Cuban guerrillas,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neil
calmly.</p>

<p>As the three came nearer the solitary
cannon, pointing its frowning muzzle menacingly
toward them, several figures suddenly
appeared from the shade of a hut by the roadside,
and peered at the approaching Americans.
One then left the group and advanced
slowly toward them.</p>

<p>The travelers saw by his uniform that he
was an officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-afternoon,&#8221; Phil called politely in
Spanish, taking off his hat.</p>

<p>The officer saluted and gazed questioningly
at the three men.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your business here?&#8221; he inquired
brusquely in his native tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we are just out for a tramp,&#8221; Phil
replied lightly. &#8220;You fellows are so persistent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
in your siege, that our legs were beginning
to get soft in the city, so we thought
we&#8217;d come out and stretch them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer smiled, pleased at the compliment
to the army in which he was an
officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;English?&#8221; he asked, relenting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, travelers,&#8221; Phil replied suavely;
&#8220;we are getting news for European papers.&#8221;
This, Phil thought, was rather clever and not
untrue, either, for what they found out would
in time find its way to European newspapers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed the officer delightedly,
who like all his race saw no good in fighting
unless his valor would be heralded to the
world, &#8220;you are just in time to see a grand
battle. We are waiting now the order to
attack. General Ruiz expects a number of
machine guns; when they arrive we shall
enter the city in triumph;&#8221; his voice rose
with excitement. &#8220;You will see the greatest
battle of the century; there will be many
killed: you are lucky to be with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil expressed his delight as best he could,
but the officer&#8217;s words had given him a distinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
shock. It would go hard with them if
Ruiz found out they had captured the arms
he was awaiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he must know they were captured,&#8221;
Phil thought suddenly. He glanced out toward
the sea. &#8220;Why, it was here that we
were fired upon.&#8221; Then he said aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this Mariel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the officer, &#8220;Mariel is over
there. Our general&#8217;s headquarters are just
behind the town. It is but a half hour&#8217;s walk
from here. I shall do myself the honor of
accompanying you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil protested that they could go on alone,
but the officer politely insisted.</p>

<p>He gave some hurried orders to a ragged
sergeant, then led the way past the gun and
up the road.</p>

<p>Phil glanced with interest at the field piece.
It was an American made gun and looked
brand new.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some more of Juarez&#8217;s rascality,&#8221; he
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Pedro Valdez, Lieutenant of
Artillery,&#8221; the officer announced, extending
his hand and bowing politely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Phil took it and stammered out the names
that came first in his mind:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Sydney, Mr. John; and my name is
Phillips,&#8221; he answered, including his companions
and himself with a comprehensive
wave of the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your comrades speak Spanish?&#8221; the
officer asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Phil replied, decidedly in haste,
fearing Sydney might answer in the affirmative.
He felt it best that there should be but
one mouthpiece.</p>

<p>After ten minutes of brisk walking, they
arrived at a pretty country villa. It was
surrounded by trees of all descriptions and
throughout the garden flowers of many colors
were growing in great profusion, filling the
balmy air with delicious perfume. The
house itself was built of the adobe so common
in Spanish speaking countries; one storied
with a central court in which more plants
and flowers gave their fragrance.</p>

<p>Another officer met them at the door and
escorted them to the courtyard, where a number
of tables were laid for a meal. The odor
of savory cooking made our friends remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
that their last meal had been breakfast.</p>

<p>After a few moments&#8217; wait, an older officer
appeared; he was dressed simply in fatigue
uniform, but wore a large gold star over his
left breast. He shook hands cordially with
the visitors.</p>

<p>There had been no introduction, but Phil
knew at a glance that this short, thin, wizened
Spaniard, was the great General Ruiz,
probably the next dictator of Verazala.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, gentlemen,&#8221; he said in his native
language. &#8220;We are very fond of the
English; they are always welcome, but your
brothers, the Americans, are different. They
do not like me, so I do not like them.&#8221; As
he spoke his face showed the vindictiveness
of his race.</p>

<p>Phil felt he ought to say something, but it
was hard to collect his thoughts. The r&ocirc;le
of impostor was a new one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for myself and friends,&#8221; he
managed finally to say. &#8220;We desire a pass
through your lines. We are writers, and wish
to send home an account of your coming
battle.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;Can I be sure you will not give your information
to our enemy?&#8221; the general answered
in a hard voice. &#8220;A spy is a danger we must
always look for in war. We shoot them like
that;&#8221; he snapped his fingers and showed
his even white teeth in a cruel smile.</p>

<p>Phil did not dare look at his two friends,
reduced to enforced silence.</p>

<p>The disguised American officers were bountifully
supplied with food and pressed to stay
over night under the general&#8217;s roof, but Phil
felt it safer to be away from under the piercing
black eye of this fiery little Spaniard.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you feel, O&#8217;Neil, when the general
spoke about spies?&#8221; asked Phil soberly,
after they had left the house behind and were
on the road again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt as if I were standing with my back
against a wall, with a file of them dago soldiers
shooting at me, sir,&#8221; answered the boatswain&#8217;s
mate with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel any too happy, either,&#8221; acknowledged
Phil, &#8220;but I hope we can soon
find out what we need to know and get back
to the city before they suspect our mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night they slept in a little pueblo inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the insurgent lines and were on the road
early the next morning.</p>

<p>During the forenoon they passed regiment
after regiment of ragged soldiers. The lads
inspected them carefully; their rifles were new
and of a late pattern, and they seemed plentifully
supplied with ammunition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have counted no less than twenty pieces
of artillery,&#8221; Sydney cried; and then pointing
to a grove of cocoanut trees ahead of them,
&#8220;and there is a whole battery of some kind
of ordnance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd,&#8221; Phil answered, &#8220;I believe we have
seen enough already, though we can&#8217;t have
seen the beginning, to report to our captain
that this revolution is of a serious character
and is probably going to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sorry for the minister,&#8221; Sydney said
gravely; &#8220;he seemed such a kind old gentleman;
but I suppose he shouldn&#8217;t have been
so credulous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel very sorry for him, too,&#8221; answered
Phil, &#8220;and I hope we can straighten this out
and save him from the disgrace of being relieved
of his office. He was new here and
speaks no Spanish at all. It was natural he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
should fall into the snare set for him by that
scheming rascal Juarez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Studying carefully everything they observed,
the three Americans moved slowly along the
road, on the borders of which the army of
General Ruiz was encamped, ready for the expected
word to assault the city.</p>

<p>An officer stepped from the grove of trees in
front and came boldly toward them.</p>

<p>Our boys regarded him indifferently until
he approached to within a few yards of them,
then their hearts sank as they recognized
the triumphant face of the American vice-consul.</p>

<p>He raised his uniform cap in mock civility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three English newspaper reporters,&#8221; he
sneered. &#8220;I have received instructions from
General Ruiz to show you every courtesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads were dumbfounded. The game
was up. A vision of a dark prison flashed
before them.</p>

<p>Phil was the first to recover himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We meet you in a new r&ocirc;le also,&#8221; he replied
in English, in a voice he tried hard to
control.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no further use for my other r&ocirc;le,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
since your meddling of yesterday,&#8221; Juarez replied
savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I suppose,&#8221; answered Phil in as cheerful
a voice as he could muster, &#8220;we must be
hereafter three American naval men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That shall not save you,&#8221; the vice-consul
growled. &#8220;General Ruiz will be delighted to
meet the men who have cheated him out of
his machine guns. With those guns he could
take the city this minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have done what any honorable men
would do,&#8221; Phil began hotly, but Juarez
turned his back with an expressive shrug of
his heavy shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, sergeant,&#8221; he called, &#8220;arrest these
spies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The worst had happened. They had met
the one man Phil had hoped he could avoid.
Their reason for being there Juarez of course
surmised, and he could defeat them by having
them locked up in an insurgent dungeon
until the city had fallen.</p>

<p>Five or six soldiers came menacingly
toward them, bayonets fixed. Phil saw the
futility of resistance. He made the sign of
surrender, but the soldier nearest O&#8217;Neil was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
a little overzealous in the use of his bayonet.
The sailor&#8217;s Irish blood was aroused; with a
swing of his powerful fist he sent the man
reeling backward, stretching his full length
on the white road.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>A TERRIBLE PREDICAMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rash act of the sailor placed the lives
of the three men in jeopardy. The soldiers
snatched up their rifles and closed in menacingly.</p>

<p>At this moment, however, a cavalcade
appeared suddenly, and the cry of &#8220;Viva
General Ruiz,&#8221; filled the air. The soldiers
near the Americans fell back sullenly, leaving
their captives alone in the middle of the
road.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; cried an officer,
spurring ahead and drawing in his spirited
animal between the Americans and the natives.
&#8220;I gave these Englishmen safe conduct.
Who dares disobey my orders?&#8221;</p>

<p>Juarez had cautiously stepped aside at the
approach of the horseman; he now advanced
boldly, wearing the air of one who has news
of the utmost importance to divulge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; for the officer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
none other than General Ruiz himself, &#8220;these
men are Americans and spies. I am lucky to
have recognized them before they were able
to re&euml;nter the city and report our strength to
the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general looked incredulous. He was
about to speak, when Juarez dropped a veritable
bombshell at his feet by hastily adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;These two young men are the American
midshipmen who captured your machine
guns at Mariel, so you see I have reason to
know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general turned fiercely on the bewildered
Americans, a dark scowl on his
sallow face.</p>

<p>&#8220;So these are the men who captured my
guns under my very eyes,&#8221; he cried in rage.</p>

<p>His face was livid with passion. His hand
sought his saber as if he would cut them
down on the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest them immediately,&#8221; he ordered in
a choking voice; &#8220;I shall make an example of
these meddling Americans. Colonel Juarez, I
appoint you their jailer. I know it is unnecessary
to caution you to guard them
well.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;Will they shoot us, sir?&#8221; whispered O&#8217;Neil
anxiously to Phil, his hand resting grimly on
his revolver handle, &#8220;for if they will, I have
six bullets here I&#8217;d like to get rid of first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boatswain&#8217;s mate was so much in
earnest that in spite of the gravity of the
situation, Phil could not repress a smile. He
suddenly paled, as the thought came to him
of what the effects of O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s rough and ready
diplomacy might be. He knew him for an
unerring shot, and the leader of the insurrection
would be the first to fall. Then their
chance for life would indeed vanish.</p>

<p>He grasped the sailor&#8217;s hand and breathed:</p>

<p>&#8220;For your life take your hand from your
revolver. They would shoot us down like
dogs if we should give them half a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Securely bound the three captives were led
back the way they had come, through inquisitive
crowds of jeering soldiers. The news of
the capture and the reasons for it spread
rapidly before them. The guards commanded
by the vice-consul had great difficulty in
bringing them alive to their prison in Mariel.
The infuriated soldiers would have torn them
limb from limb.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>The squalid prison was a relief after this
nerve-racking ordeal. The guards, although
saving them from fatal bodily injury, could
not shield them from the vicious blows, taunts
and insults showered on them from all sides.
If it had not been for the fear Juarez had for
General Ruiz, he would gladly have given
them up to these wild beasts.</p>

<p>They were indeed in a sorry plight as they
were roughly pushed into a cell of the prison
and the heavy oaken door closed loudly behind
them.</p>

<p>The lads were stunned. But a half hour
ago, they were free men, enjoying their precious
liberty in the bright world outside;
full of boyish enthusiasm for their discoveries.
Now they were held captive by a cruel tyrant
who hated their race and to whom they had
given good cause. He might, without a
qualm of feeling, have them shot as spies.
Their country was powerless to help them.
In undertaking this duty they had relinquished
their claim upon the protection of the
United States.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was the first to recover from these
despondent thoughts. He glanced about their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
narrow prison, but his gaze failed to discover
aught encouraging, so it returned and rested
compassionately on the two lads.</p>

<p>They had thrown themselves full length on
the rude benches that lined the walls of their
cell and had given themselves up to melancholy
reflections.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said, appealingly,
to Phil, as the young man looked up with an
expression of utter dejection; &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t
give in, Mr. Perry; we ain&#8217;t dead yet, and
what&#8217;s more, sir, we ain&#8217;t a going to be, either.
Mrs. O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s son John has been in as tight
places before and has come out with a whole
hide&mdash;&mdash; Which is more than he is going to
do this time,&#8221; he added with a grin, showing
a deep cut in his thigh. &#8220;That little dago
that I knocked down poked his bayonet in
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment the boys were all interest, forgetting
their own troubles in their anxiety for
their wounded companion.</p>

<p>Phil pulled a first-aid bandage from his
pocket and held it up in triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;They took everything else from me,&#8221;
he exclaimed; &#8220;your new revolver, too, Syd.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;Yes, and the first time we carried them,&#8221;
Sydney answered ruefully, as they made the
boatswain&#8217;s mate bare his wound, which they
washed and dressed carefully.</p>

<p>They had hardly finished their solicitous
attentions when the door of the cell was unlocked
and flung open: Colonel Juarez appeared.</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway, his arms folded, a
cruel smile curling his weak mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You defeated me once,&#8221; he jeered, &#8220;but I
shall see that you will never get a chance
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crestfallen lads only stared. They
could find no voice to answer. The hatred
in his eyes appalled them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you believed yourselves very
clever,&#8221; he continued, irritated at the silence
of his hearers, &#8220;but if it will make you feel
any better, I can tell you that your brilliant
work has but delayed us. We shall possess the
arms soon enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads were startled at this intelligence.
Could it be true? Phil could not conceive
how Lazar would have the audacity to deliberately
allow the arms to be taken. Where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
were Marshall and Morrison? Then he realized
that they were in ignorance of the true character
of their superior officer. They would
suspect nothing. Why had he not put them
on their guard?</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you this,&#8221; Juarez added, after a
pause to permit them to grasp the full meaning
of his words, and to gloat over the lad&#8217;s
discomfiture, &#8220;because dead men tell no
tales. To-morrow you will be tried by drum-head
court martial,&#8221; and shrugging his
shoulders, &#8220;I am the president of the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was about to reply when he saw how
futile speech would be. The man had come
to taunt them. Silence was their best course.</p>

<p>Seeing that his victims could not be moved,
he turned and left them.</p>

<p>They heard his voice in the hallway loudly
instructing the guards:</p>

<p>&#8220;If the Americans attempt to escape, shoot
to kill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe Lazar has given up the
guns?&#8221; Sydney questioned as Juarez&#8217;s steps
died away, forgetting the dire threat in his
anxiety for their cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear Juarez speaks the truth,&#8221; Phil answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
dejectedly; &#8220;I blame myself for not
having cautioned Marshall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you shouldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said Sydney;
&#8220;as things have turned out, it would have
been wiser. But how were you to know? It
seems incredible that a naval officer, even if
he is a scoundrel, would take such a risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of Lazar&#8217;s character will stoop to
any depths for money,&#8221; exclaimed Phil, &#8220;and
you can be sure that the sum promised him by
Juarez is large.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But his commission in the navy,&#8221; Sydney
persisted, unconvinced. &#8220;If this crime is discovered
he will at least be dismissed the service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of his unnatural talents and intriguing
nature soon finds but little scope for
himself in the service, where all are poor but
honorable,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;No doubt he has
contemplated leaving the service and the fear
of detection, therefore, has no influence with
him. As for dismissal, that would be out of
the question; the crime of which we know he
is guilty would be nearly impossible to prove
before a naval court martial. Our evidence
is only hearsay, and might not convict him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;Our evidence,&#8221; Sydney commenced; then
the life died out of his voice as he added,
&#8220;we may never be able to give it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The failing light of day, entering the solitary
window above their heads, soon left the prisoners
in darkness. The lamp used by their
guards outside their cell door shed a faint
glimmer through the cracks of the stout oaken
panel.</p>

<p>The terrible mental strain which the Americans
were enduring gave them scant desire
to sleep, and as they tossed restlessly on the
damp floor of their cell their predicament
gradually dawned upon them with startling
force.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil alone was cheerful; his indomitable
spirit saved the lads from sinking too deep in
the slough of despond.</p>

<p>Phil lay awake long after his companions
had forgotten their troubles in sleep. The
bitter thought of failure was even keener to
him than the dread of death. The watch-word
of his profession was &#8220;death with honor.&#8221;
Why should he fear to die in his country&#8217;s
service? It was the end that all true naval
men sought. Yet, it was hard to die so young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and when there was so much to live for.
Then the thought of his two companions
filled his cup of sorrow brimful. He cried
out against a fate so cruel. If they all could
but die fighting, but to be shot down by these
miserable half-civilized soldiers, as they might
shoot so many dogs, was more than his youthful
spirit could bear. He dropped off finally
into a profound sleep, and when he awakened
the next morning, he found the door of their
cell open and the guards ready to take them
before the military tribunal.</p>

<p>Hands bound behind their backs, they were
marched through the streets of the town. The
natives taunted them with vile epithets, but
kept themselves at a distance, for which favor
the captives were grateful.</p>

<p>After a short march they were led into a
courtroom. Here they were unbound and
told roughly to sit down.</p>

<p>A few moments elapsed, then three officers,
led by Colonel Juarez, appeared and took seats
at a table in front of the Americans.</p>

<p>The room was empty save for the court,
the guard and the prisoners.</p>

<p>Colonel Juarez arose and read in a monotonous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
voice from a paper in his hand. Phil
understood it to be the order of General Ruiz,
convening the court for their trial as spies.
Juarez sat down in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you to say in your behalf
before we pass sentence?&#8221; he asked coldly,
turning to Phil as spokesman.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s throat was dry. He tried to speak
but could not find voice.</p>

<p>Juarez turned hastily to his companions.
Each nodded his head in assent; the trial was
finished and the accused men found guilty.</p>

<p>Hot blood rushed to Phil&#8217;s face as he comprehended
the awful import of this hasty verdict.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dare not carry out this sentence,&#8221; he
cried wildly, jumping to his feet. &#8220;It will
be murder. We are not spies. Our country
is not at war with yours. True, we are here
to find out the strength of your forces, but it
is not to take this information to your enemy.
If you do this monstrous deed you will place
yourself beyond the pale of civilization&#8221;&mdash;his
indignation choked him. &#8220;I claim my right
of appeal to General Ruiz,&#8221; he demanded
fiercely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>The court sat unmoved. On Juarez&#8217;s
features was a grim expression of enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take them away,&#8221; he ordered, rising to
dismiss the court.</p>

<p>As the guards advanced upon the prisoners,
a voice from the door stilled the room. The
officers of the court clicked their heels together
at &#8220;attention,&#8221; and the guards brought
their rifles quickly to the &#8220;present.&#8221; Turning,
Phil&#8217;s gaze encountered the steely eyes of
General Ruiz.</p>

<p>The insurgent commander walked calmly
forward, motioning the guards away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your verdict, Colonel Juarez?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guilty. To be shot to-morrow at sunrise,&#8221;
the colonel replied grimly.</p>

<p>Then turning toward the Americans, he
surveyed them critically, a cunning gleam in
his sharp black eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may speak,&#8221; he said condescendingly,
dismissing the court with an eloquent gesture,
and waving back peremptorily the awaiting
guards.</p>

<p>Phil endeavored to collect his scattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
wits. He knew that his appeal would be
their last chance for life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the general demanded impatiently,
&#8220;be quick, I have but little time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil felt his body break into a cold perspiration.
His heart sank within him. He
saw his words must fall on barren soil. The
whole attitude of this powerful, cruel leader
was unfriendly.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Ruiz,&#8221; he commenced, intense
earnestness in his young face, &#8220;you must not
do this terrible deed. We have not intentionally
done you harm. Our mission in
your camp is not one of war, but only diplomatic
in character. I cannot tell you its
nature. Believe me when I say we are innocent
of crime against the laws of war. We
are not your enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not my enemies!&#8221; exclaimed the
leader savagely, his voice rising in anger.
&#8220;Then why did you capture my machine
guns? Explain that, if you can?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was silent. He could not tell this
man the reason; to do so would betray his
country&#8217;s policy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you see your arguments are not convincing,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
he cried triumphantly. &#8220;Must I
allow those who are not my enemies to capture
my property, then spy on my military
movements? Shall I be powerless to lay by
the heels such fellows, and shoot them as they
richly deserve?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a thought seemed to strike him; he
led Phil away out of ear-shot of his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall grant a reprieve under one condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is?&#8221; exclaimed the boy, his
hopes rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you cause my guns to be delivered
inside my lines,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s hopes vanished. That he could
not do. He had rather die first. He shook
his head determinedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;even if I
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general, misinterpreting the meaning
implied in the boy&#8217;s words, hastily explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;The arms are this minute in La Boca, but
the government and your ship are so vigilant
that I dare not risk attempting to bring them
here by water, and by land is quite out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
question. If I release you, you could find a
safe way to evade detection under the protection
of your flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>The price was tempting to the despairing
American youth: three lives for a cargo of
arms, but the vileness of the act which he
must commit to obtain this reward was repulsively
horrible. Phil tried hard to control
his indignation. He felt that to show this
man how much he despised him and his
clemency would only hasten their end.</p>

<p>Ruiz believed the lad was wavering.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I release you now, by to-night you will
be on board the &#8216;Connecticut&#8217; and by to-morrow
I shall receive the guns and enter the
city at the head of my victorious army.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil thought quickly. Here might be an
opportunity to gain for America the gratitude
of this insurgent leader. If Ruiz was to
win the city and set himself up as dictator,
this act could be used with great force to defeat
the intrigues of Juarez and La Fitte and
Company. But could he depend upon earning
this man&#8217;s gratitude? Would he not forget
and vent his venom on the Americans
notwithstanding? The more he thought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
more complex the situation appeared. What
did he know of the strength of Ruiz&#8217;s enemies?
Phil had heard rumors that they were
negotiating for war vessels; with these against
them, the insurgents could only hope to win
by gaining the crews of the ships to their side
by golden bribes; if they remained loyal to
the government, Ruiz would not dare enter
the city. The war-ships could train their
guns on his army and force him to evacuate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall give you until sunrise to-morrow,&#8221;
the general added sternly, &#8220;then if you agree,
I shall have you set free, but shall retain your
companions as hostages for your good faith
until the arms are in my hands. If not&#8221;&mdash;a
sinister smile and an expressive shrug of his
thin shoulders completed his meaning.</p>

<p>The Americans were led back to their cell
and as the door closed upon them again, Sydney
turned anxiously to Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>Phil told his eager companions the one
chance of escape from the fate awaiting them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t accept it,&#8221; Phil concluded. &#8220;It
will look as if we were afraid to die, and to do
this we shall become Lazar&#8217;s accomplices, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
I feel assured he has allowed the arms to be
stolen from the legation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil interrupted, &#8220;I know
these dagos, having shipped with them both
afloat and ashore. They ain&#8217;t going to shoot
us. It&#8217;s a bluff&mdash;stage acting. You stand
pat to-morrow morning. They may line us
up against a wall and point their guns at us,
but they ain&#8217;t a going to shoot. They know
if they did the United States government
would blow the whole blamed country out of
existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ring of truth in the sailor&#8217;s words
forcibly impressed the two lads. Could this
be true? Had they been tortured to make
them betray themselves? But the cruel look
in the face of Ruiz when he turned and left
them only a short time before, surely did not
bear out this interpretation of their position.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are right, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil said,
looking gratefully at the cheerful sailorman,
&#8220;but I fear these men are capable of carrying
out their threat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Escape was impossible&mdash;they were as secure
in this prison as if they were in the old
Bastile. The footfall of their guards told of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
their vigilance. The heavy oaken door was
doubly barred and locked on the outside.</p>

<p>Their midday meal lay upon the floor untasted
by the two lads. Food would have
choked them; but O&#8217;Neil ate as calmly as if
he were aboard ship.</p>

<p>The sounds of life outside came faintly to
their ears. They heard the laughter of children
playing in the streets, and the rattle of
military accoutrements, as soldiers marched
along. The heat of their dungeon was almost
unbearable and they suffered from lack of
water to wash their bruised bodies.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard the sounds of alarmed
humanity; startled cries, a hurrying of many
feet, and the clang of iron shod hoofs upon the
hard earth.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil listened intently. Then he sprang
to the window near the ceiling of their cell,
catching the sill with his fingers and drawing
himself up until he could peer through the
iron bars.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cried both lads in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something going on to seaward,&#8221;
he answered; &#8220;the people are running about
like chickens without heads, and the soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
are moving inland. I wish we could get a
sight&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His next word was lost in a heavy crash
and sharp explosion that seemed to shake the
building to its foundation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it an earthquake?&#8221; cried Phil, excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounded to me like a six-inch shell,&#8221;
exclaimed O&#8217;Neil. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t heard one so
close since Santiago, but I recognize the tune.&#8221;</p>

<p>Explosion after explosion followed in rapid
succession.</p>

<p>&#8220;The streets are deserted,&#8221; shouted O&#8217;Neil
above the roar of crashing buildings and exploding
shells. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bombardment. There&#8217;s
a ship or two pumping shell into the town
from the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor slid down from his position of
vantage and pointed to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our guards have run for it. We must
break down that door.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three Americans, simultaneously, flung
themselves against the stout oak, but it held
firmly despite their united efforts. They
stood in the middle of their cell, the perspiration
pouring from their exhausted bodies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>A crash louder and sharper rang in their
ears. Then an explosion that threw them
violently to the floor. The suffocating fumes
of the exploded shell filled their nostrils.</p>

<p>But yet another and more sinister smell
reached them, which froze the hot blood in
their veins; it was the smoke of a burning
building.</p>

<p>Their prison was afire. If the door held
they would all be burned alive.</p>

<small>THE SCENE CHANGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> terrible plight spurred them on to renewed
efforts to break down the heavy door.
The iron bolts were bent under their frenzied
onslaughts, and the stifling smoke became
thicker.</p>

<p>The ominous sounds of bursting shell grew
louder and more frequent.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are shelling this very building,&#8221; exclaimed
O&#8217;Neil, as he gathered himself for a
spring at the resisting oak.</p>

<p>The two lads were almost in a panic. The
situation seemed indeed hopeless. The crackling
of the approaching fire was very near;
so close that the air of the cell was becoming
too hot to breathe.</p>

<p>Then an explosion, that seemed to the anxious
prisoners as if the building itself had been
destroyed, sent them reeling to the farthest
limits of their narrow prison. They clutched
the hot wall for support. The mingled smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
of powder and burning wood was so thick that
they could see but a few feet. Phil felt a
sharp pain and glanced down with horror to
see blood flowing down his leg. He knew he
had been wounded; he did not know how
seriously.</p>

<p>He peered through the thick smoke for his
companions. Sydney was near him, his
clothes torn, showing the effects of the explosion.
O&#8217;Neil was not visible. Phil groped
through the suffocating smoke toward the
door. He heard a crash of splintered wood
accompanied by a glad cry from the sailor,
and then the cell was lit up by a red glow of
fire through the hole made by the boatswain&#8217;s
mate in the oaken door. O&#8217;Neil stood, peering
through the breach; the explosion of the
shell had started, and he had, with his powerful
hands, enlarged it. His glance was
calm, but the sight, to Phil, was calculated to
unnerve the stoutest heart. The hall outside
was a veritable furnace, and it was their only
road to safety. They were surely lost. How
could they pass through this scorching heat
alive?</p>



<p>&#8220;Come, it&#8217;s our only chance,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Neil.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
&#8220;It&#8217;s sure death here. The building may fall
at any minute.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_162.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>THE THREE PRISONERS RUSHED<br />
THROUGH THE FLAMES</i></p>

<p>Singly the Americans crawled from the
comparative cool of their cell to the hall,
through the breach in the door. The door of
the building had been left open by the retreating
guards, and showed white through the red
glare of the flames.</p>

<p>Hand in hand the three prisoners rushed
through the scorching flames. The red
tongues reached out on all sides toward their
retreating forms.</p>

<p>A second afterward they were all buried
in sand up to their necks in order to quench
the smouldering fire in their clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought our numbers were made<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that
time,&#8221; exclaimed O&#8217;Neil when they had succeeded
in extinguishing the flames. &#8220;It was
that shell what done the business. I&#8217;d like
to see the man who fired it. I&#8217;d give him
my month&#8217;s pay. The shell exploded just on
the outside of the door and splintered it so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
that I could get my hands on the pieces.
But come, this is none too safe, we must get
to the seashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>With shells exploding over their heads they
ran pell-mell through the deserted town to
the beach.</p>

<p>As a view of the sea flashed before the lads,
they cried out in excitement.</p>

<p>The dark hull of a war vessel steamed a
quarter of a mile off shore. They saw the
bright flashes from her gun ports followed by
a harsh screech of shell and then a crash and
explosion which seemed to be at their very
feet.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil looked about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get to that fish trap,&#8221; he cried,
pointing to a cluster of bamboo piles driven
under the water, their ends appearing above
the surface. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be safe there until we can
signal the dago war-ship; do you see the flag
of the republic flying from her trucks?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wading and swimming the Americans
made their way to the fish trap. It was just
at the end of the coral reef, and when the
vessel had finished the bombardment they
would surely be seen and rescued.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>From the hills back of the town came a
report of cannon and a shell struck the water
near the cruiser.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friend the artillery lieutenant,&#8221; exclaimed
Phil, as the brown vapor from the
exploded shrapnel appeared again in the air
above the cruiser. &#8220;He knows her range
too. She is turning. I wonder if they have
seen us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll see us in a minute,&#8221; answered
O&#8217;Neil grimly, as he stripped himself of his
white undershirt and drew from the sand
a long bamboo pole. &#8220;But our artillery
friends ashore may see us also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they do, we must swim for it,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neil calmly, tying his shirt on to the pole
and raising the conspicuous flag above his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;They see us; I mean the cruiser,&#8221; cried
Sydney joyfully; &#8220;she is heading toward
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cruiser had turned in shore; her battery
was now silent, but the spiteful piece of
artillery ashore sent its bursting shrapnel
ever nearer the approaching vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get under the water, quick,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Neil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
grasping the lads and drawing them down
with him.</p>

<p>Through the water the noise of an explosion
above them came muffled to their ears.
When they rose to the surface, the agitated
water about them told the story only too
plainly. O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s fears had been realized.
The enemy had also seen them.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for our friends that they
were all good swimmers. They must leave
the protection of their bamboo piling and
swim toward the approaching man-of-war.
With but their heads above water they would
afford but a small target for their friend the
lieutenant of artillery, but if he was fortunate
with his aim once it would be all over with
the Americans.</p>

<p>Leaving their insecure resting place they
swam slowly out toward the cruiser, which
had now stopped and seemed to be awaiting
them.</p>

<p>The cool freshness of the water put new
strength into the swimmers. O&#8217;Neil swam
on his back, his eyes turned toward the shore.
As soon as the red flash appeared he commanded
his companions to duck, and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
escaping the shower of bursting shrapnel,
they reached the side of the cruiser in safety.</p>

<p>Willing hands helped them aboard and up
the gangway of the war-ship, which now
steamed away, hurling a parting broadside
into the deserted and burning town.</p>

<p>The Americans indeed presented a sorry
spectacle; with clothes torn nearly off their
bodies, smoke-begrimed, and burned painfully
in many places; but their new found friends
on board received them with great courtesy
and cheerfully supplied all their needs.</p>

<p>In but a short time their wounds and burns,
which were found to be only slight, were
carefully attended to by the ship&#8217;s surgeon,
and they appeared on deck with the only
clothes available, those of the government
officers.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia, the commanding officer of
the cruiser, insisted that the lads should
live with him in his cabin, and O&#8217;Neil was to
be given a place among the officers themselves.</p>

<p>After the experiences of the last few hours
all three were exhausted, and the captain, with
tactful generosity, refrained from asking their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
story until the rescued men could be refreshed
with a bath, clean clothes and a
bountiful dinner.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney lay back in the commodious
cabin of the war-ship and, in spite of
their eagerness to hear the latest news from
La Boca, fell into a profound sleep.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the afternoon that
the lads were awakened by Captain Garcia.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are feeling refreshed,&#8221; he
inquired kindly. &#8220;I am delighted to have
you with us for a few days until I can take
you back to your own ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a few days,&#8221; Phil exclaimed in
astonishment; &#8220;aren&#8217;t you going back now to
La Boca?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry if I seem to carry you away
against your wishes,&#8221; he replied courteously,
&#8220;but I am sailing under very imperative
orders from my president to seek the rebel
cruisers at Rio Grande. It was but by accident
that I went into Mariel. I saw a great
many soldiers of the enemy drawn up there
and took the opportunity to worry them, and
at the same time give my gunners an opportunity
to test our new guns.&#8221; He stopped and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
inquired, &#8220;But tell me how you and your
two companions came to be there; was I the
means of liberating you? I have not heard
as yet your experiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had forgotten that the captain had received
but little information as to the reasons
why they were at the fish trap, from which
they had swum to safety. He at once told
their story: of their capture, the trial and
the verdict, and then of the escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;We owe our lives to you, Captain Garcia,&#8221;
he added gratefully. &#8220;If your shell had not
exploded in front of the door of our prison, we
should have been burned alive, and if you had
not stopped to bombard Mariel we would still
be there looking forward to being shot to-morrow
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am indeed thankful that I have been
able to serve those who prevented the cargo of
machine guns from falling into the hands of
our enemy,&#8221; the captain answered smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know we did that?&#8221; cried
Phil in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;The story has reached our president,&#8221;
Captain Garcia responded, &#8220;and he is very
grateful to the Americans. Now,&#8221; he added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
&#8220;our launches are watching every exit by
water, so General Ruiz finds himself effectively
cut off from his base of supplies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil remembered the machine guns were
not in the legation and quickly his thoughts
turned to his uncompleted mission. The
pulsations of the engines showed the vessel
was steaming away rapidly from those who
should have his report at the earliest
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you not take us back to La Boca?&#8221;
he asked anxiously. &#8220;I have secret information
which must be received immediately by
my captain on board the &#8216;Connecticut.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is impossible,&#8221; replied Captain
Garcia; &#8220;we are over a hundred miles from
La Boca, but if you will trust the message to
me I can send it safely by wireless telegraph.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face lit up with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall get the message ready at once,&#8221; he
answered much relieved. &#8220;You will pardon
me if I send it in cipher?&#8221; he asked; &#8220;I
should not like to divulge its import to even
our rescuer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney put the message, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
former framed, in the cipher code of the
United States. Our lads fortunately had
been given the key word by Captain Taylor
before they started on their perilous mission.
Without this secret word the message could
not be read by outsiders, so although the
boys knew that all the foreign ships in port
would read this message to the &#8220;Connecticut,&#8221;
none but Captain Taylor could find it intelligible;
to the others it would be a meaningless
confusion of unpronounceable words.
The message told the captain of the battle-ship
that the machine guns were no longer in the
legation but concealed in the city of La Boca,
and that the insurgent army were strong and
well equipped with modern rifles and
artillery; that they alone lacked machine
guns, of which their race stood in great dread;
that the cruiser &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was on its way
to Rio Grande to fight the enemy&#8217;s men-of-war,
and that they were on board and
well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that will be sufficient, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
Phil asked Sydney, after they had laboriously
put the long message in the cipher code.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sydney replied, &#8220;unless you wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
to put the captain on his guard against a
traitor in the legation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The time is not ripe for that yet,&#8221; Phil
answered promptly; &#8220;we must wait until
the evidence against him is overwhelming.
Remember Captain Taylor has a high opinion
of Lazar and if we attempted to poison his
ear against him, he might, even though he
likes us, believe that we had formed a combination
against the ensign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have your own way,&#8221; responded Sydney,
impatiently, &#8220;but I fear by the time we
return to the &#8216;Connecticut&#8217; all the damage
that he is capable of doing will be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can he do more, Syd?&#8221; Phil exclaimed.
&#8220;If he has given up the guns he
must stop there, for there is nothing more
that he can do that will injure the United
States.&#8221;</p>

<p>The message completed they took it to
Captain Garcia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the wireless room with me,&#8221; requested
the captain, &#8220;and we shall see it
started on its long journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was delighted at the opportunity. He
had always been interested in this wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
method of telegraphy, but had not been able
to make as complete a study of it as he would
have desired, owing to his time being too thoroughly
occupied since his reporting for duty
in the Atlantic fleet.</p>

<p>Sydney also was included in the invitation,
and the two lads followed Captain Garcia to
the little compartment in which the delicate
instruments were installed.</p>

<p>The operator, a bright-faced foreigner, stood
up civilly as the three entered, and took the
message held out to him by Captain Garcia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send this to the American battle-ship,&#8221; he
ordered. &#8220;We shall remain here to see you
manipulate your instruments.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wireless man smiled proudly as he put
his hand carelessly on his sending key.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is her call letter?&#8221; he asked
politely, turning to Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;A-D,&#8221; the lad replied promptly.</p>

<p>The switch was closed and the whirring of
the mercurial motor showed the expert that
all was ready to commence.</p>

<p>The man closed his key and on releasing it
a bright spark jumped across the spark gap,
charging the storage jars with electrical fluid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
of a high tension. The lads understood that
this had electrified the aerial wire leading to
the main truck of the cruiser and a wave of
electricity had been started on its journey
through space. Again and again in long and
short makes and breaks the key was pressed
down upon its platinum contact. A-D in
dots and dashes was sent up to the long wire.
After a minute the key was held at rest and
another switch was thrown in, connecting this
same wire to the receiving instruments. All
held their breath in expectancy while the
operator placed his telephone receiver to his
ear. Phil watched the man&#8217;s face anxiously.
He saw on it a look of satisfaction. Then he
saw him again close his key, press it down
twice in acknowledgment, then glance at the
paper before him.</p>

<p>A hundred miles away the aerial wire of
the &#8220;Connecticut&#8221; was set in electrical vibration.
The American operator below the
armored deck heard an even but indistinct
buzz in his telephone receiver. He listened
intently. It was surely his own call. Who
could be signaling him. He must be sure, for
he did not wish to interfere with the messages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
among the foreign war-ships. No, it was distinct
enough. A-D, A-D, unceasingly. He
waited until the noise ceased, then quickly
he sent out his acknowledgment, turning the
rheostat handle for high tension, for he knew
the sender of this mysterious call was at a
long distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have her, se&ntilde;or captain,&#8221; the operator
of the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; reported in a businesslike
voice as he proceeded to send the cipher
message before him.</p>

<p>Phil breathed easier after the last acknowledgment
had been received from the &#8220;Connecticut.&#8221;
The captain in but a few minutes
would know the situation as well as if they
themselves had told him in person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that this is off our minds,&#8221; exclaimed
Phil, as he and Sydney walked up and down
outside the captain&#8217;s cabin, &#8220;I believe it our
duty to discover how strong this ship is for
fighting two of her enemy&#8217;s vessels. I am
delighted to be here, but at the same time I
don&#8217;t care about getting killed, or what might
be worse, captured. If our friend Ruiz gets
us in his power again, it will be all up with
us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;What do you propose to do?&#8221; asked Sydney
excitedly. &#8220;I wish we could fight her
for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that we couldn&#8217;t do; but we are surely
justified in instructing them before the battle,
and during the battle too, for we can satisfy
our conscience by the plea of self-defense,&#8221;
answered Phil, regarding closely a six-inch
gun near him. &#8220;Look at their guns; they are
the very latest pattern and have two telescope
sights each. These men in but a short time
could be trained to use those guns in a way
that will insure a victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In training these men to fight a successful
battle,&#8221; Sydney returned, thoroughly interested,
&#8220;we shall also help the government to
keep in control of the country. Do you
know for what reason we were sent to the insurgent
camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To find out their strength, of course,&#8221; answered
Phil promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but why did our government wish
this information? The reason has just occurred
to me. Some of the foreign governments
wish to give the insurgents the power
of belligerents. This the United States does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
not desire, for it will give them an opportunity
to blockade La Boca with their navy and thus
ruin our shipping with that port. Our merchant
vessels, and also those of foreigners, may
be seized at the will of these outlaws, and this
situation would be disastrous. La Fitte and
Company have a powerful backing in two
countries of Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, I believe you have hit the nail on
the head. Why couldn&#8217;t I have thought of
that?&#8221; exclaimed the lad, proud of his companion&#8217;s
sagacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, there&#8217;s all the more reason,&#8221; Phil
added, &#8220;why we should do our utmost to see
that these insurgent war vessels never have an
opportunity to blockade La Boca.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly it,&#8221; answered Sydney
promptly, &#8220;and as we are due in Rio Grande
in two days more we should start right in
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was sent for and told of our lads&#8217;
plans. The boatswain&#8217;s mate was greatly delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me two days, sir,&#8221; he cried excitedly,
&#8220;and they&#8217;ll make a hundred per cent.
of hits on the insurgent hulks.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>The three Americans walked down to the
battery deck. The crew were at quarters.
Each division was going through the drill at
their guns in a perfunctory manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at &#8217;em,&#8221; scoffed O&#8217;Neil, &#8220;like a gang
of Italian roustabouts on a New York dock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After this drill is over, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; Phil confided,
&#8220;you get a group around you and try
to interest them; then get them at the gun
and explain how it should be done. You
must poke fun at them in order to catch their
interest. Then we shall see that Captain
Garcia sees you. That ought to open his eyes
and make him want to see more. Do you
see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I do,&#8221; exclaimed the sailor, &#8220;and
you have hit the character of these dagos as if
you&#8217;d always lived among &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney strolled quietly up the
ladder and entered the captain&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was quite willing to be
drawn into conversation, and our lads diplomatically
led the topic up to the possibilities
in the coming engagement.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you have been so frank with me,&#8221; answered
the captain, in reply to an inquiry from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
Phil, &#8220;I shall tell you what is my greatest
anxiety.&#8221; He lowered his voice to a whisper.
&#8220;The navy to a man were in sympathy with
the rebels, and as soon as General Ruiz began
to collect his army and threaten the capital,
our two war vessels, the &#8216;Soledad&#8217; and &#8216;Barcelo,&#8217;
with a torpedo-boat, sailed from La Boca
for Rio Grande, where they won the sympathy
of the citizens and set up the capital of the rebellion.
My men are wavering in their allegiance
to our cause, and if they should mutiny
and take the ship, turning it over to the
rebels, our cause would be lost.&#8221; He stopped
speaking and glanced seriously at his eager
listeners. &#8220;My life would of course be sacrificed.
I should either be shot by the mutineers
or else executed by our enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was indeed a startling announcement
for our lads. A mutiny on board the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221;
might be as serious to them as it
would be for her captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Aquadores,&#8217;&#8221; the captain continued in
the same low tone, &#8220;is a powerful ship. She
was built in your country for our government,
and when this war broke out, a power held
her at the dockyard, although I had my crew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
on board and was ready to sail; it was the
government of the United States. I could not
set sail until your country was satisfied of my
honest intentions. She is more than a match
for the ships of our enemy, but our men are
poorly trained, our officers are half-hearted
and incompetent, mere adventurers. They
would willingly fight against their country if
they believed it would be to their personal
advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys felt a deep sympathy for Captain
Garcia. They saw in him a man of a
thousand, differing materially from the majority
of his race. Honorable, brave and
loyal, he was ready to die for his cause. Believing
he was sailing toward his death, they
had known him for over twenty-four hours
and had not, until this minute, heard one
word of complaint.</p>

<p>The sound of many people talking loudly,
with excited cries and exclamations, struck
upon their ears.</p>

<p>The captain&#8217;s grave face turned a shade paler.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Phil knew immediately that O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s strategy
was bearing fruit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; he proposed, advancing to the
hatchway.</p>

<p>They descended the ladder and stood in astonishment
at the sight presented.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had indeed succeeded. He had
placed a crew at one of the six-inch guns and
was making the men go through the drill
in American style. The native sailors were
laughing with excitement. They were as
happy as if they were playing at some athletic
game.</p>

<p>Phil glanced anxiously at Captain Garcia.
The latter&#8217;s face had dropped its careworn expression.
His eyes brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if I had a crew like that man,&#8221; he
sighed.</p>

<p>Phil was silent. The time had not arrived
to offer the aid of himself and his two friends.
He knew the pride of the race to which the
captain belonged. He knew by his face that
he was a pure-blooded Castilian.</p>

<p>Some hours later in the cabin the expected
question that Phil had waited for was asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, will you and your friends teach
my men to use our guns?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil readily agreed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;That removes a great burden from my
mind,&#8221; exclaimed Captain Garcia gratefully.
&#8220;When will you begin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, at once,&#8221; answered Phil promptly.
&#8220;I must be given authority to order the men
about, and to do this I desire to be given the
temporary rank and wear the uniform of your
first lieutenant. My friend, Mr. Monroe, must
have the rank of lieutenant, and O&#8217;Neil an
ensign. In this way only can we control our
pupils.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain was in high glee. He fell in
immediately with the spirit of the undertaking.</p>

<p>Donning the uniforms, which fortunately
were in store on board, the Americans set to
work to carry out the scheme outlined by Phil.</p>

<p>The battery was divided into two divisions,
one of which was to be commanded by each of
his companions with the native officer as
assistant. Phil himself was to be near the
captain and was also to control the fire of the
broadsides.</p>

<p>The next night our friends had reason to
congratulate themselves upon their wonderful
progress. The crew were imbued with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
lively interest and fell to with a will to perfect
themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;My country can never repay its debt to
you, se&ntilde;ors,&#8221; the captain exclaimed to the
lads after they had returned from their last
drill. The enemy would be encountered the
next morning, if their commanding officers
had the courage to fight. &#8220;I do not now fear
the outcome. My greatest fear has been swept
away; it was that if the shells of our enemy
were to hit us too frequently our men might
become demoralized and in spite of me haul
down our flag. There can be no danger of
that now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning all hands were called before
dawn and preparations were made for the
coming battle. The lads were consumed with
excitement as they moved among the willing
sailors. The rapid shooting with which Phil
hoped to overwhelm their two antagonists was
provided for by placing at the guns a quantity
of reserve ammunition. O&#8217;Neil went among
the men joking with them and telling them
what was expected of them. Their Latin blood
was aroused to the highest pitch of excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see these guns?&#8221; he cried, changing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
his voice to a harsh tone, pointing to two revolvers
in his belt. &#8220;I have twelve dead
men here. The first dozen men who show
cowardice are as good as dead right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>By sunrise the low land of the Bay of Rio
Grande was in sight. The red-roofed town,
nestling against the side of the dark green of
the forest, reflected the slanting rays of light.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; steamed boldly toward
the forts at the entrance.</p>

<p>Phil felt confident that Sydney and O&#8217;Neil
would give a good account of themselves in
the battle, the outcome of which meant so
much to the Americans.</p>

<p>As he took his station on the high bridge
near the captain, the fire control instruments
in his hands, his pulses throbbed with an excitement,
the height of which he had never
known before. Was this the feeling men had
on the eve of their first battle?</p>

<p>The cruiser drew nearer to the defending
forts. The range finder showed five thousand
yards was their distance from the cruiser.</p>

<p>Suddenly a brown puff of smoke belched
from one of the forts, and the screech of a
huge shell sounded ominously.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shell from the fort struck the water
some hundred yards ahead of the &#8220;Aquadores,&#8221;
and showed Captain Garcia that unless he
stopped his ship, he would draw the fire of the
forts. This would place him at a decided disadvantage.
His best course was to entice the
ships of the enemy away from the protection
of the fortifications. That the captain understood
his proper tactics was soon evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard astarboard,&#8221; he ordered, and the
cruiser, obedient to her helm, quickly swung
her bow around and headed directly away
from the harbor&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>Phil thrilled with the excitement of the
moment; he glanced at the captain&#8217;s face; it
showed plainly the tremendous strain that he
was undergoing, although he seemed outwardly
calm and deliberate. The gravity of
their position came home to the lad; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
were on the eve of a battle between modern
ships with modern guns and its outcome meant
either life or death.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the &#8216;Barcelo,&#8217; heading out,&#8221; cried
Captain Garcia. &#8220;I believe she will give us
battle; her mate must be behind the fort and
we shall soon see what their intentions are.
If they refuse to fight in the open, out from
the protection of the fort guns, I shall be forced
to enter the harbor regardless of the mines
and heavy guns ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil paled at the thought of entering the
enemy&#8217;s fortified harbor, strongly protected by
mines. He knew that the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221;
could have but little chance in such an undertaking.
A single mine exploded within a
few feet of her bottom would send her skyward.
But a look at Captain Garcia&#8217;s face
showed his intense earnestness; he would risk
all in his endeavor to destroy the rebellious
navy of his country.</p>

<p>The enemy&#8217;s vessels had now left the harbor.
They were in plain sight, their battle
flags waving from their trucks. They presented
a noble appearance, cleared for action,
the naked muzzles of their long high-powered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
guns pointing toward the apparently fleeing
cruiser.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a beautiful sight!&#8221; Phil exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but deadly,&#8221; Captain Garcia replied,
casting an apprehensive glance at the oncoming
ships. &#8220;They are both nearly new and
formidable. They doubtless hope for an easy
victory, as they know of the half-heartedness
of my men. But we are going to surprise
them,&#8221; he added, his face brightening; &#8220;I
believe they will catch a tartar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are surely going to win,&#8221; cried Phil.
&#8220;Your men can shoot each of their guns eight
times in a minute; we shall overwhelm them
with that fire. Your crew loads in the American
method; our enemy know nothing of its
advantages. We can depend upon my companions
to keep their gun&#8217;s crews at work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the range?&#8221; inquired the captain
in a tense voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four thousand yards,&#8221; Phil answered,
measuring deliberately with his instrument,
&#8220;and gaining rapidly. Your stern guns can
open fire now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know my countrymen better than you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
do, lad,&#8221; he said lowering his voice, so as not
to be heard by the officers and men near him.
&#8220;If we should open fire now they would come
no further, but remain under the protecting
wing of the fort guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; cried Phil delightedly; &#8220;you are
making them believe you are afraid of them
and are running away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; replied the captain proudly,
pleased at the compliment to his ability. &#8220;We
shall draw them far out to sea and then turn
on them and force a fight. I know their
speed; it is but seventeen knots; while with
the &#8216;Aquadores,&#8217; I am sure of twenty-one at
any time. So you see they cannot then escape
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty-eight hundred yards,&#8221; Phil reported,
taking his eyes from the instrument
and looking at his watch. &#8220;What speed are
you making, captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen knots,&#8221; was the prompt answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they are going almost seventeen
knots now,&#8221; Phil vouched, as he put his
watch away; &#8220;they have gained two hundred
yards in three minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is so, I must go faster,&#8221; cried Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Garcia, signaling to the engine room to
increase the speed. &#8220;I wish them to gain
slowly in order that we may be well out from
the harbor when they reach an effective range
with their guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that sun?&#8221; cried Phil, pointing
toward the red disk but an hour high.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a bad thing to have in your gun
sights. Get between your enemy and the sun
and you have the advantage at the start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; cried Captain Garcia. &#8220;It
will spoil the enemy&#8217;s aim, and it places me
in an advantageous position to head them off
if they attempt to escape me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s nerves had become quieter, although
the long strain of the stern chase had been
heavy. He glanced below him on the gun
deck to observe the behavior of the crew.
Silence was ponderous over the ship. The
men at first had talked in low excited tones
to each other, but as they saw the enemy
draw nearer, they stood quietly, dreading the
first screech of their enemy&#8217;s shell. Sydney
and O&#8217;Neil seemed cool and collected as they
stood with their officer assistants. Sydney
glanced anxiously through the gun-port, frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
judging the distance of the enemy,
but O&#8217;Neil appeared to give the enemy but
scant thought. He seemed to be as calm as if
he were at target practice. To him the excitement
of battle was not new; he had served in
Admiral Sampson&#8217;s fleet during the Cuban
campaign, and the sound of shells screeching
about him gave him no fears.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she goes,&#8221; Phil exclaimed loudly in
excitement, as a flash of fire sprang from the
leading ship.</p>

<p>A tremor ran through the crew. Their
evident nervousness showed on their faces and
in the muscular twitching of their hands.</p>

<p>The first shell struck short, but from the
bow guns of the two chasers flash after flash
appeared. The screech and hiss of steel
missiles filled the air.</p>

<p>Phil looked at the captain anxiously. The
latter stood surveying the scene, nervously,
with his hand on the wheel rim.</p>

<p>The menace of the enemy&#8217;s fire was
becoming more intense. The geyser-like
splashes threw water on to the decks of the
fleeing cruiser. Then a crash below him on
the battery deck sent the hot blood pulsating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
through the lad&#8217;s veins. He looked, a terrible
fear in his eyes. He saw fresh blood on
the clean white decks amid the suffocating
smell of an explosion. The swarthy faces below
him had paled with an unknown,
unreasonable terror&mdash;men scrambled over the
mutilated bodies of their stricken comrades,
then stopped, wild-eyed and frenzied, for they
saw no escape. He glanced appealingly at
Captain Garcia; the latter&#8217;s face had blanched
but his voice rang out true:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard astarboard! Full speed!&#8221; Then
he turned to Phil:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are ready to open fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad, with hands trembling with agitation,
read the range and transmitted it by his
electrical instrument to the guns. The notes
of the bugle rang out clear on the battery
deck: &#8220;Commence firing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney and O&#8217;Neil drove the men to their
guns at the point of the revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any of you fellows shoot when you
ain&#8217;t pointing at that leading ship,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
sang out in Spanish, in a voice that could be
heard above the crash of exploding shell and
the frightened prayers of the sailors, &#8220;I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
going to pitch you to the sharks with my
own hands,&#8221; and he looked as if he meant
every word. No doubt the little brown
sailormen thought he would carry out his
dire threat, for they moved slowly back to
their stations.</p>

<p>The next moment the situation was relieved.
The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; swung her port
broadside to the enemy and the sharp detonating
discharge of her guns made her crew
forget their fear of the enemy&#8217;s shells.</p>

<p>Phil with glasses to his eyes watched their
shells wing their way toward the enemy.
The roar of discharges now grew incessant.
The leading cruiser was fairly blotted out by
the splashing of steel all about her.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was not escaping unscathed;
the dead and dying littered the
decks, but the crew, with desperation born of
their dread for their officers&#8217; revolvers, worked
like madmen.</p>

<p>Phil saw a heavy pall of smoke rising from
the leading cruiser, now heading about in an
endeavor to seek the shelter of their fort&#8217;s
guns. It was the &#8220;Barcelo.&#8221; The &#8220;Soledad&#8221;
was yet unharmed and stood boldly on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
using her guns with terrific effect. He
rushed down to the battery deck. He found
his companions drawing their men back to
reload the guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;One enemy is disabled,&#8221; he cried desperately.
&#8220;Back to your guns. If you desert
now it means death. Shoot at the other ship!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men went once more to their guns, a
sullen scowl on their terrified faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;For our lives, keep them at it,&#8221; he shouted
to O&#8217;Neil as he swung himself up the ladder
to the bridge.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Soledad&#8221; was heading directly for the
&#8220;Aquadores.&#8221; The white foam under the
bow of the former showed she was making a
rush to close with her enemy.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was undecided. He stood
with his hand ready to clutch the wheel to
retreat. The &#8220;Soledad,&#8221; a blaze of destruction,
came on with a speed that seemed well-nigh
incredible. At the shorter range her shots
were falling thickly about their decks, and
the cries of the wounded were heartrending.</p>

<p>Phil saw with consternation that she was
approaching on a converging course, and if
the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; stood on the two vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
must meet in but a few minutes. What would
Captain Garcia do? Sydney and O&#8217;Neil were
nowhere in sight. The battery fire had been
reduced alarmingly; but four guns were now
firing against ten of their enemy. What could
have happened to his companions? Then a
sudden wave of joy filled his heart. O&#8217;Neil
and Sydney were both shooting guns themselves
and the officer assistants had taken two
others. The excited sailors were working as
hard as their limited strength allowed them,
and from the guns of the Americans, Phil saw
with delight, the one hundred pound shells in
a perfect stream were hurled, true to their aim
against the side of the advancing ship.</p>

<p>Phil read his range finder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two thousand yards,&#8221; he cried, then he
froze with sudden fear. &#8220;Have they torpedoes?&#8221;
he questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>There was no time for an answer. A puff
of white smoke, low down on the &#8220;Soledad&#8217;s&#8221;
leaden side; a flash of bright metal in the
sunlight, and a silent splash in the water, told
our lad only too plainly that five hundred
pounds of high explosive had been launched
on its deadly errand against their ship.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Phil&#8217;s voice refused obedience. The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221;
stood on at full speed, while he saw a
white wake of air bubbles in a straight line,
ever extending, marking the path of the
Whitehead torpedo.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia hesitated but a moment;
then he grasped the spokes of the wheel and
spun it around, swinging the bow of the
cruiser toward the approaching destroyer.</p>

<p>The men below, intuitively, knew that some
new danger threatened. An ominous murmur
arose from the guns. The dread of an unknown
danger had put the fear of death into
their simple minds.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; turned swiftly, yet it
seemed to the anxious watchers that she must
place herself directly in the path of the torpedo.
Our lad knew that the captain had
now made the only correct maneuver; by presenting
his bow to the torpedo, it would give
less surface to the steely fish, and a glancing
blow on the curved under-water side of the
cruiser might not explode its death-dealing
head.</p>

<p>Through his glass Phil watched the fast approaching
tube of steel. It was running but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
a few feet under the clear blue water, leaving
behind it a trail of bubbles from the air exhausted
through its tiny engines.</p>

<p>It seemed to the lad that the torpedo could
not miss. He grasped the hand-rail near him
to brace himself against the terrific impact of
the explosion he knew would come with the
speed of light when the deadly point of the
tube plowed into the &#8220;Aquadores&#8217;&#8221; steel
plates. He could not withdraw his fascinated
gaze from the approaching menace; yet he
heard ominous sounds on the deck below him
that showed him the awful plight of the
cruiser.</p>

<p>The torpedo was now very near, pointing
directly for the bow of the &#8220;Aquadores,&#8221; ever
swinging toward its small enemy.</p>

<p>A flash of steel across the cruiser&#8217;s bow; a
whir of tiny propellers; a white streak of
foam, and the danger had passed. Death had
brushed close by and gone beyond on a futile
errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to your guns,&#8221; Captain Garcia cried,
steering his vessel toward the now retreating
enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t put them out of business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
now,&#8221; Phil heard O&#8217;Neil shout to the uncertain
men, &#8220;they&#8217;ll let loose another one of
them torpedoes, and they&#8217;ll hit us sure next
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the gunners returned to the battery, the
roar of discharges brought confidence to the
panic-stricken crew.</p>

<p>It was soon the &#8220;Aquadores&#8217;&#8221; turn to be
joyful. The demoralized enemy were running
for cover. Their fire had almost ceased,
but the deck of the cruiser, strewn with dead
and dying, told of the havoc while it had
lasted.</p>

<p>Those on the bridge had, by a miracle,
escaped unharmed. Phil had felt many a
shell pass him, scorching him with its hot
blast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Concentrate on the nearest vessel,&#8221; Phil
shouted to his companions below him. The
range was but scant two thousand yards.
The &#8220;Aquadores&#8217;&#8221; shell went true to their
aim. The smoke of explosions on the deck
of the nearer vessel rose in clouds, almost
concealing her from view. She had fired a
few shots with a stern gun as she turned to
follow her fleeing mate; this now ceased. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
was bending all efforts to escape. Once under
the cover of their shore batteries they could
refit the ships and again be ready for battle.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia&#8217;s face wore a look of determination
as he took in his hand the flexible
speaking-tube to the engine room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make all speed possible,&#8221; he ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cripple her,&#8221; he cried to his gunners below.
&#8220;Let neither escape us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The intense excitement was fairly stifling.
Both vessels of the enemy were making more
speed than Captain Garcia had given them
credit for being able to do. The distance was
not increasing but they were persistently holding
their own, and the &#8220;Aquadores&#8217;&#8221; shooting
had not, despite the volume of fire, succeeded
in reducing their speed by even the
fraction of a knot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aim at her water line,&#8221; Phil shouted to
his companions, pointing at the &#8220;Soledad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next few shots from the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221;
were fired singly by O&#8217;Neil. Phil sent him
the exact range from his range finder, while
Sydney saw the sight bar was accurately set.</p>

<p>The first shell struck only a few yards
short, in her white wake. The next shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
struck under her counter and exploded with
an echoing report.</p>

<p>&#8220;You jammed her rudder,&#8221; Phil shouted
jubilantly, as he saw the &#8220;Soledad&#8221; sheer
widely to starboard and expose half of her
broadside to the bow fire of the chaser. O&#8217;Neil
saw his opportunity to plant a number of
shells against her water line. Putting the
cross wire of his telescope sight fairly and
steadily on her water line amidships, he fired.
The watchers on the bridge anxiously followed
with their eyes the shell speeding
toward the &#8220;Soledad.&#8221; Then the sound of
a mighty explosion filled the air and the
hindmost enemy was blotted out in a cloud
of white, vapor-like smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her boilers have exploded!&#8221; cried Phil,
grasping Captain Garcia&#8217;s arm in his excitement.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Barcelo,&#8221; as if fearing the terrible
punishment of her mate would be visited
upon her, had stopped dead on the water.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia steamed his vessel cautiously
up to the vanquished enemy.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Soledad&#8221; was a pitiful sight as she
rolled a shattered hulk on the ocean swell;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
smoke-stacks gone; her decks blackened with
the fire of explosions, and torn and rent by
the terrific violence of the blown up boilers.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s sinking,&#8221; cried Phil in horror, turning
anxiously to Captain Garcia.</p>

<p>The captain nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear many of her crew have perished.
We must save every life we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was stopped near the
sinking ship and boats were lowered promptly.
But as Captain Garcia had feared, there were
but a handful of survivors left on the surface
after the &#8220;Soledad,&#8221; her colors still flying,
sank beneath the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>In a half hour more a prize crew from the
&#8220;Aquadores&#8221; had been sent on board the captured
&#8220;Barcelo&#8221; and the two vessels, now no
longer enemies, lay quietly awaiting the darkness
to finish the work of destruction of the
insurgent navy; a torpedo-boat must yet be
accounted for before Captain Garcia could sail
back to La Boca and report to his president
that his work had been successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Barcelo&#8217; is quite serviceable,&#8221; Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
Garcia informed the American lads, after his
return on board the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; from his
visit to the captured vessel. &#8220;She suffered
badly from our shells and has lost many men;
fortunately her surgeons are uninjured, and
are now attending to her wounded. Our losses
have been heavy; I weep for my poor countrymen,
fighting against their own flesh and
blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia burst into tears. The sight
quite unmanned the youths. It was a new
sight for them&mdash;a man, who had borne himself
with so much bravery through the terrible
trials of the last few hours, breaking down
and crying like a child.</p>

<p>The lads tried to console the sorely tried
man, but he was inconsolable. The reaction
on his Latin nature was more than his nerve
could stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have placed me under a heavy debt,&#8221;
the captain said, his voice breaking with emotion.
&#8220;I believe in my heart that without
your superb assistance, my ship would now be
beneath the waves instead of the &#8216;Soledad,&#8217; or,
which is far worse for an honorable man, lying
there vanquished, my flag trailing in the dirt.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
He pointed through the gun-port at the battle-scarred
&#8220;Barcelo,&#8221; her lowered flag still trailing
from her mast in sign of surrender.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think of it in that way,&#8221; Phil hastily
assured him. &#8220;We have served our own ends
as well as yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have risked your lives many
times for our sacred cause,&#8221; cried Captain
Garcia. He took each by the hand, while
tears of gratitude streamed down his face. &#8220;I
take your hands as brothers; and that superb
sailorman! if he would join our navy our
president would make him a captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads were pleased and proud that their
work had been appreciated so highly by their
friend. Their short acquaintance with his
noble character tended to change the opinion
they had formed of the men of his race. This
man was surely one of nature&#8217;s noblemen.</p>

<p>The boys thanked him warmly for his
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have risked our lives, Captain Garcia,
in your cause,&#8221; Phil replied earnestly, &#8220;because
your cause happens to be our cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;However you put it,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
shall always consider that you three Americans
have given us this victory. We could
never have won without your aid, and our
president shall richly reward you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be impossible, sir,&#8221; Phil explained
quickly. &#8220;Do not believe us unappreciative,
but you must not tell any one of
the part we have played in this battle. I pray
you will counsel secrecy to your officers and
men. It will do us much harm if the truth
were known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was more perplexed than
ever. He shrugged his shoulders as much as
to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man, your American ways are entirely
too complicated for me to understand.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>CAPTAIN GARCIA&#8217;S STRATEGY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain</span> Garcia&#8217;s face showed the midshipmen
his keen disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are denying my men and myself a
rightful pleasure,&#8221; he answered after an appreciable
silence. &#8220;They are acclaiming you
their deliverers and I fear they will not observe
my orders when I counsel secrecy. Se&ntilde;or
O&#8217;Neil is already their idol; to a man they
are wildly enthusiastic over his rough and
ready ways, and unless I am much mistaken
the praises for the three Americans will be
sung in every house in La Boca a short time
after we have returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Captain Garcia,&#8221; Phil replied hastily,
a sudden fear in his voice, &#8220;you must tell the
men that by speaking of our work on board
the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217; they will injure those to
whom they wish well. Our future careers in
the navy may be jeopardized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never fear them,&#8221; exclaimed the captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
earnestly, seeing the alarm on the lad&#8217;s face.
&#8220;My men know that they owe you their lives.
They shall be silent. I can vouch for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia soon departed to lay his plans
for the coming night, leaving the boys in the
cabin. It was the first time they had been
alone since the battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, you were a wonder during the
fight,&#8221; Phil began enthusiastically; &#8220;you appeared
to be as cool as if you were only drilling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t cool,&#8221; Sydney confessed; &#8220;I was
all-powerfully scared, I can tell you. As the
men deserted the guns, when the &#8216;Soledad&#8217;
fired her torpedo and the shells were exploding,
it seemed all about me, I felt as near like
making a mile run as I ever did in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only modesty,&#8221; Phil declared in
admiration. &#8220;You acted like a veteran
under fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad I didn&#8217;t show my true feelings,&#8221;
he replied much pleased, &#8220;but to me the
greatest marvel was O&#8217;Neil; he doesn&#8217;t know
what fear is. I saw him, on two occasions,
catch in his arms a man who had been
killed at his side by an exploding shell, lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
him gently out of the way of the guns, and go
back to his work with jaws set like iron and
his eyes flashing with the joy of fighting. A
crew of such men could do miracles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, during the fight, when I saw O&#8217;Neil,
I forgot the sense of fear myself,&#8221; he cried
gladly. &#8220;He was superb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you really mean what you told the
captain here,&#8221; questioned Sydney anxiously;
&#8220;that our careers might be endangered if the
part we took in the battle were known?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I did,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;Our enemies
could use it against us and do us a great deal
of harm. My conscience is clear, however;
our lives were in mortal danger and our
actions were prompted by the natural law of
self-defense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell Captain Taylor what we
have done?&#8221; Sydney asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I shall have to make a clean breast
of it to him,&#8221; Phil declared. &#8220;He may condemn
our actions and even send us home in
disgrace; but we must take that risk. He
should know all. From now on we must return
to our r&ocirc;le as neutrals. I do not know
what Captain Garcia&#8217;s plans may be, but I feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
sure he will not be satisfied until the torpedo-boat
is disposed of. She will remain a
menace to the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217; as long as she
floats and flies the flag of the rebellion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we shall take no further part in the
fighting,&#8221; exclaimed Sydney ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not unless we can do so justly,&#8221; his
companion answered. &#8220;It will have to be in
self-defense. We dare not take the initiative in
a hostile act&mdash;&mdash; Hallo! We are moving
rapidly,&#8221; he added glancing through the gun-port,
&#8220;and we seem to be heading toward
La Boca. We surely cannot be going to
abandon the torpedo-boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>It took the midshipmen but a few moments
to appear on deck. There they saw that the
&#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was steaming swiftly to the
northward, followed by the &#8220;Barcelo.&#8221; The
harbor of Rio Grande was gradually fading
astern.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; exclaimed Sydney.
&#8220;If I were Captain Garcia I&#8217;d make short
work of the torpedo-boat before I left this
port. One of these dark nights she may steal
into La Boca harbor and torpedo the
&#8216;Aquadores.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;I am not so sure that he is abandoning
the idea of destroying her,&#8221; replied Phil
thoughtfully. &#8220;I have come to consider him
a clever naval officer. There is some good
reason for his action. Let&#8217;s go to the bridge&mdash;I
am sure he will enlighten us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads found Captain Garcia in the wheel
house carefully studying the chart of Rio
Grande.</p>

<p>Phil shot a swift glance at Sydney as he
divined the captain&#8217;s intentions. &#8220;There&#8217;s
more work ahead,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>The captain raised his head finally and
greeted the midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;The more I look into this matter the
more hazardous it appears,&#8221; he confided, a
worried look on his face. &#8220;I may undo the
effect of our victory by losing both ships.
Yet I cannot return to La Boca and report
one vessel still at large and a menace to our
cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain paused and seemed in deep
thought. The boys regarded him intently in
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am resorting to strategy,&#8221; he finally explained,
pointing ahead in the direction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
La Boca. &#8220;It is now three o&#8217;clock; there are
three more hours of daylight and by dark we
shall be fifty miles from Rio Grande. Our
enemy will watch us pass below the horizon
and I hope will believe that we have continued
our way northward. As soon as it is
dark I shall turn about and steam back for
the harbor at full speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys were consumed with delight at the
plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have reasoned thus,&#8221; continued Captain
Garcia smiling in spite of himself at the lads&#8217;
eager faces: &#8220;the torpedo-boat, believing we
have gone, may leave the harbor and go outside
to reconnoitre. She will go out to the locality
where the &#8216;Soledad&#8217; sank; there is a great deal
of wreckage there which has undoubtedly been
seen from ashore. I am depending upon the
curiosity of my countrymen to see the ill-fated
spot. If she should leave the harbor
now she would be back inside before I
could turn and head her off, but if she
delays until sunset she will find me
waiting here at the harbor&#8217;s mouth on her
return. When we reach the entrance the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
&#8216;Barcelo&#8217; will leave us and search to seaward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if she is still inside?&#8221; questioned
Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall sacrifice the &#8216;Barcelo,&#8217;&#8221; the
captain answered quickly, &#8220;in an attempt to
run the mine fields to engage the enemy inside.
The night will be moonless and the
advantage will be with the attacking force.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys could not hide their admiration
of the captain&#8217;s strategy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you ever have thought of
it?&#8221; cried Phil delightedly. &#8220;I believe that
is exactly what she will do.&#8221; Then a thought
came to him. &#8220;But if she is outside will she
not discover you before you see her? You
dare not use your search-lights, for she can
then easily avoid you and escape into shallow
water, where you could not follow her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the risk of war,&#8221; Captain Garcia
answered grandiloquently. &#8220;If she torpedoes
us we must sink her even if we ourselves
are sunk. My government can buy another
&#8216;Aquadores.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The two vessels steamed swiftly away from
their enemy. The sun sank slowly toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
the horizon to the westward. The midshipmen
watched the molten ball dip into the
fiery sea. Darkness came quickly, for in these
latitudes there is no twilight.</p>

<p>Inside of ten minutes night had settled
down over the sea and the war-ships had
turned about and were steaming at full speed
toward the enemy&#8217;s harbor.</p>

<p>The hours passed with leaden feet. Cloud
banks which had been visible on the horizon
before sunset slowly spread a filmy mantle
over the sky, blotting out the brilliant tropical
stars. The night became darker. With all
lights screened, the gray hulls moved noiselessly
through the calm sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she is outside the night is in her favor,&#8221;
Captain Garcia said, peering through the inky
blackness. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t see her five hundred
yards away, while from her low deck she
could see our hull at nearly twice that distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe our better chance is to enter the
harbor after all,&#8221; exclaimed Phil, losing heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;But think of the mines and the guns of
the forts,&#8221; replied the captain; &#8220;for me, I&#8217;d
rather find her outside. She can hardly be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
lucky enough to sink both ships, and I have
confidence that we shall sink her if we see
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Phil questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I count upon my American friends
for aid?&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Phil hesitated. If the torpedo-boat attacked
them it would be surely self-defense for them
to help defend the cruiser.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are entirely at your service, sir,&#8221; he
declared, &#8220;if the boat is outside. I am sorry,
but our aid cannot be given otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia seemed perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find I become ever more heavily
your debtor. Are all American naval men
like you and your companions?&#8221; Then he
added sincerely, &#8220;I pray that some day I
shall be given an opportunity to show my
gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys took his proffered hand and wrung
it warmly.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil stepped hesitatingly on the bridge.
The lads seized upon the sailor and brought
him up beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now?&#8221; he inquired, peering into
the darkness ahead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>The situation was quickly explained.</p>

<p>The boatswain&#8217;s mate&#8217;s face lit up with
pleasure for a moment, then he turned to Phil,
a troubled note in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them dagos can&#8217;t hit even the water at
night,&#8221; he whispered; &#8220;some of them have
been begging me to come and find out what&#8217;s
going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the enemy&#8217;s sailors are just as much
afraid of the dark,&#8221; Phil declared in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;These men ain&#8217;t sailors,&#8221; he answered
disgustedly, &#8220;they are soldiers, landlubbers.
All the sailormen of the country are with the
rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden idea struck the lad. He turned
from O&#8217;Neil toward Captain Garcia, wrapped
in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Garcia, O&#8217;Neil says all your men
are soldiers,&#8221; he cried anxiously.</p>

<p>The captain nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to take them,&#8221; he returned; &#8220;the
sailors were disloyal to a man. I was naval
attach&eacute; at the outbreak of the war in Washington
and was forced to be satisfied with the
men my government sent to me to man my
ship.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;How many prisoners have you?&#8221; Phil
questioned hurriedly.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia&#8217;s face brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see your drift,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I believe I
can depend upon them. We have over a
hundred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put them at the guns, sir, and have your
soldiers stand over them. I&#8217;ll make them
shoot straight when I tell them it&#8217;s &#8216;Davy
Jones&#8217; locker&#8217; if they don&#8217;t,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil urged.</p>

<p>In a short time the hundred rebel sailors
were liberated from the lower hold and put
at the guns. The old crew, rifles in hand,
were placed as sentries about the ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me for the rigging if those chaps mutiny,&#8221;
laughed O&#8217;Neil, pointing to the scores of riflemen,
carelessly handling their pieces, guarding
the captured sailors at the big guns. The
loom of the land near Rio Grande was now
dimly discernible on the starboard bow.</p>

<p>The two cruisers slowly closed in toward
the shore. The vibrations of the engines
lessened. The war-ships were soon motionless
in the water. The harbor entrance had
been reached.</p>

<p>Phil glanced apprehensively through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
darkness. He could see dimly the smudges
of forts, but he knew from them the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221;
and her mate, although but a scant
half mile distant, were quite invisible; their
steel gray sides blended in with the dark sea
and sky, showing an unbroken line.</p>

<p>His companions were at their stations at
the guns. Every gun was loaded and ready
to be fired instantly.</p>

<p>Phil from his station at the range finder
above the battery deck peered down on the
scene below him. He could make out the
shadowy figures of the men at the guns; he
saw the men at the sight telescopes and the
anxious loaders behind the breech of each
gun, with the shell and powder ready.
O&#8217;Neil stood almost directly under him; he
seemed to be the unconscious man-of-war&#8217;s
man surrounded by perils.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put down those firing keys,&#8221; he cautioned.
His voice was low, but it sounded
distinct and commanding over the silent
deck. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be getting nervous and shooting
off before we clap eyes on her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Barcelo&#8221; steamed by; she had received
her orders from Captain Garcia to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
search the neighborhood of the wreck for the
enemy.</p>

<p>They watched her slowly dissolve in the
night.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s pulses beat fast. The moment was
fraught with grave perils. The unseen torpedo-boat
might be even then aiming a deadly
blow at the motionless cruiser.</p>

<p>The crew were all watching intently;
keyed to the highest pitch of nervous excitement;
their eyes set fixedly, staring into the
total gloom about them; alert for the first
sound of the approaching enemy.</p>

<p>The attitude of the prisoners was reassuring;
they could not load as rapidly as O&#8217;Neil
had made the soldiers do; but they were
used to naval warfare, they were on their own
element, the night and the unseen danger
held for them many terrors, but they were
not so terrified as their soldier comrades;
also they had been told that they would all
be drowned if the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was torpedoed
and that if they refused to fire they
would suffer death from the soldiers&#8217; rifles.
Phil felt confident the sailors could be depended
upon. He glanced aloft at the search-light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
platforms, high above the bridge deck;
the operators stood ready, like shrouded
statues, silhouetted against the starless sky.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was the man of action, one
hand on the telegraph to the engine room
and his other on the switch for the search-lights,
his eyes peering into the night.</p>

<p>Phil read his intention at a glance: on the
discovery of the enemy to start ahead at full
speed and flash both search-lights on her
simultaneously.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Barcelo&#8217; should be there by now,&#8221;
the captain said in a tense voice to the lad
beside him. &#8220;Will my strategy fail? Have
I made an error in my judgment of my
countrymen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was silent. His nerves were at too
high tension to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Barcelo&#8217;s&#8217; orders were if she discovered
the torpedo-boat,&#8221; Captain Garcia
continued in a nervous whisper, &#8220;to turn
her search-light upon the enemy and steam
at full speed toward us. We shall remain
dark. My dread is that our enemy may be
now returning to the harbor and will suddenly
find me in her path.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;But even if that happens will she be able
to fire a torpedo immediately?&#8221; questioned
Phil in a voice he tried hard to control.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her torpedoes will be in the tubes,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;and probably primed ready to be
fired, but she must first aim her tube at us
and not suspecting that we are near, there
should be a sufficient interval for us to sink
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia had been so fully occupied
gazing to seaward that he had failed to notice
that the tide entering the harbor was slowly
setting the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; in toward the forts.
An exclamation from the lad at his side made
him throw an apprehensive glance over his
shoulder at the near-by shore. It seemed
very close. He seized the engine room telegraph
and signaled for full speed ahead.
But a flash from the batteries and a sullen
roar showed him their thoughtlessness had
discovered them to the watchful enemy. The
shells screeched over their heads and struck
the water with a spiteful hiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have lost,&#8221; Captain Garcia exclaimed
in bitter anguish; &#8220;if the torpedo-boat is out
she can easily avoid us, knowing we are near.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
From her deck she can see us long before we
can sight her. My hope was that they would
not be watchful; now they have been warned
and will run cautiously.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; slowly gathered speed
and, turning, steamed out to sea in the direction
taken by her consort.</p>

<p>Shell after shell followed her, but in the
darkness the fort&#8217;s aim was bad; the gunners
ashore could not know the range.</p>

<p>Suddenly Phil saw a flash far out on the
ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, a shot,&#8221; he cried breathlessly, grasping
the captain&#8217;s arm in his excitement. A
distant boom came to their ears.</p>

<p>Flash followed flash in rapid succession,
as if a firefly were flying low above the
horizon. Then a white shaft of light cut
the blackness, swung undecidedly to and fro,
and then held steadily on the water.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s glasses trembled as he gazed at the
end of the light shaft.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia&#8217;s voice rang out joyfully
when his keen eyes saw the small white object
under the search-light&#8217;s ray, far out on
the ocean.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;Be ready, men, she&#8217;s coming this way.
Either they will sink, or we shall. You
must choose&mdash;I promise full pardon to all&mdash;if
we sink her.&#8221;</p>

<p>A low murmur ran along the decks. In it
were betrayed both joy and fear:&mdash;joy for the
promised reprieve, fear at the sudden unknown
danger of the approaching torpedo-boat.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s clear voice was raised in cautioning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, men. Don&#8217;t fire; she&#8217;s too far
away. Wait till I give you the word. Then
fire for your lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; turned swiftly toward
the object illuminated by the search-light of
the &#8220;Barcelo.&#8221; The former ship was in complete
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you read the range?&#8221; questioned the
captain&#8217;s eager voice.</p>

<p>Phil put his eyes to the range finder and
moved a switch which made the torpedo-boat&#8217;s
bright hull appear as a line of light. He
moved his wheel and brought the direct and
reflected rays together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five thousand yards,&#8221; he announced.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;Let me know when she is twenty-five
hundred yards away,&#8221; said Captain Garcia.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was steaming at full
speed toward the rapidly moving torpedo-boat.
They were approaching each other at
terrific speed, yet to the overwrought midshipman
it seemed an age when his range
pointer reached the distance given him by the
captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five hundred yards,&#8221; he cried, his
voice rising with an excitement he was
powerless to control.</p>

<p>A second afterward the blinding flashes
from the &#8220;Aquadores&#8217;&#8221; guns, accompanied by
ear splitting discharges, made the scene on the
cruiser one of terrible splendor.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Barcelo&#8217;s&#8221; search-light still illumined
the enemy, but she had by her superior speed
drawn out of range of the former&#8217;s guns.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s fascinated gaze held to the torpedo-boat
with grim tenacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s lost her,&#8221; he cried, as the end of the
&#8220;Barcelo&#8217;s&#8221; search-light swept uncertainly
over the water. The boat had vanished into
the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease firing,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s stentorian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
voice, as he saw the torpedo-boat had slipped
away from the discovering light.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8217;&#8221; lights were flashed and
groped about in despair for the lost vessel.
The sailors stood terrified at their guns.
O&#8217;Neil walked coolly along the deck, shaking
men roughly to wake them out of their stupor
of fear&mdash;some had fallen to praying on their
knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we pick her up you&#8217;ll need all your
prayers,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t shoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil felt he was nearer a panic than he had
ever been; he walked up and down, his eyes
following one struggling beam and then the
other; he almost resolved to go up to a search-light
himself. Captain Garcia during the moments
of uncertainty had turned his vessel toward
the harbor&#8217;s entrance. He would brave
the fire of the forts if that could prevent his
prize from escaping. He was ready to sacrifice
his ship in this last attempt.</p>

<p>Suddenly through the black night Phil
saw a darker shade on the surface of the water.
It seemed but a stone&#8217;s throw away. His voice
was paralyzed. He tried to speak but it was
impossible. His lips gave out unintelligible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
sounds. Grasping Captain Garcia&#8217;s arm, he
pointed a trembling finger at the dread object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Port quarter, quick, your search-lights,&#8221;
shouted the captain.</p>

<p>The lights, before uncertain, now swung
obediently to the assigned direction, and in
the bright glare, the torpedo-boat flashed in
sight heading bows on to the luckless cruiser.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look. Shoot,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Neil to the
gunners fascinated, terrified; while he and
Sydney stormed among them.</p>

<p>It seemed ages before the tension was relieved
by the discharges of their own guns.</p>

<p>The torpedo-boat was so close that the range
finder could not get her distance. She could
not be over five hundred yards away and coming
on with terrific speed. Even now a Whitehead
torpedo might be speeding below the
inky water on its mission of destruction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>LAZAR&#8217;S CUNNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next few moments were ones long to be
remembered. The daring torpedo-boat was
making a desperate attempt to sink the
&#8220;Aquadores,&#8221; which stood between herself
and safety. Her small dark hull stood out as
bright as day under the search-light beams.
Hundred pound missiles from her huge enemy
were churning the water to foam about her;
one lucky hit and she would be no more.</p>

<p>With heart beating tumultuously and breath
abated, Phil saw a group of sailors at her forward
torpedo-tube. Spellbound, fascinated
as one who gazes into the green spark-like
eyes of the cobra, he could not take his eyes
from the ominous sight. The tube moved
slowly around; those moving it were apparently
careless of the thunderbolts striking
so near them. Two of the men stepped back
quickly, one remained at the tube. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
torpedo-boat was within short torpedo range of
her enemy.</p>

<p>A flash of fire from her miniature bow; then
a great geyser of water shot high in the air
from under her forefoot. At last a shell had
reached her. Her bow sank as she drove forward,
until she was half submerged. Then,
all in a moment it seemed, her stern lifted in
the air, and the last of the rebel navy took
a graceful dive to the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p>The incident came so suddenly that but
few on board the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; could grasp
the meaning of what had happened. The
search-lights showed a seething sea where the
enemy had but a second before been visible.
The gunners of the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; could see
nothing through the sights; the discharges
ceased suddenly. The crew gazed about
them in fear that some new and more dangerous
peril was at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was her torpedo,&#8221; Phil cried in joyful
relief. &#8220;She fired it, and as it struck the
water a six-inch shell must have hit the high
explosive head. It&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cease firing,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Neil as he saw
some of the gunners were about to reopen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
fire. Phil&#8217;s words had been in English and
had conveyed no intelligence to the anxious
sailors. &#8220;She&#8217;s gone to the bottom, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia stood overcome with conflicting
emotions. After his first wild joy
had died away his thoughts dwelt upon the
fate of the brave men who had a moment
before with splendid courage aimed a deadly
blow at his vessel.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was brought to rest
amid the whirling eddies, the aftermath of
the explosion of hundreds of pounds of gun-cotton;
but there was not a living shape on
the surface of the sea: all had perished
gallantly and their torpedo-boat had furnished
their bodies a fitting sepulchre.</p>

<p>Four days brought the cruiser in sight of
La Boca. To the three Americans on her
bridge, straining to catch the first glimpse of
their ship, it seemed an age since the day on
which they had set out so cheerfully to seek
information within the rebel lines. The experiences
of the past ten days were like a bad
dream from which they were fast awakening.</p>

<p>Rounding the headland the harbor burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
into view with its fleet of vessels anchored
therein.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole battle-ship squadron is there,&#8221;
exclaimed Phil in amazement. &#8220;What does it
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reply. Captain Garcia&#8217;s face
showed that he too was surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be but one explanation,&#8221; he
answered; &#8220;your government fears the intervention
of some foreign power. That
array of fighters would deter any open act.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; and the captured
&#8220;Barcelo&#8221; steamed in between the sentinel
forts at the entrance and then between the
lines of the American war vessels.</p>

<p>Cheer after cheer arose from the mighty
ships as the battle-scarred veterans steamed
swiftly past.</p>

<p>The lads&#8217; nerves tingled and Captain
Garcia&#8217;s eyes filled with tears. He was
touched beyond words at this enthusiastic
greeting.</p>

<p>As soon as the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was anchored
the Americans were ready to leave the ship
on board which they had been through so
many thrilling scenes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;I am sorry to part,&#8221; Captain Garcia declared
with genuine grief. &#8220;You have all
endeared yourselves to me in many ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>They expressed their thanks to the gallant
captain and as they passed through the motley
crew the men broke out in excited cheers for
&#8220;los Americanos.&#8221; O&#8217;Neil was surrounded by
an admiring crowd, all shouting enthusiastically;
they hugged him and cried over him
and would have forcibly detained him on
board. O&#8217;Neil stood it like a stoic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them dagos are like a lot of women at a
wedding,&#8221; the boatswain&#8217;s mate declared disgustedly,
when they had left the ship and
were being rowed across the water to the
&#8220;Connecticut.&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;d thought I was the
bride, the way they embraced me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad we can talk our own tongue
once more,&#8221; remarked Phil. &#8220;It seems so
long since I used it that I&#8217;ll be talking Spanish
to everybody I meet; I have the habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>A steam launch flying the American flag
passed close by the Americans in their boat
flying the Verazala flag at the stern. An
officer wearing the uniform of an ensign
saluted promptly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the last salute we&#8217;ll get from an
ensign for some years,&#8221; chuckled Sydney as
they returned the salute. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that
fellow feel cheap if he knew we were only
midshipmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had quite forgotten how we are dressed,&#8221;
Phil laughed, &#8220;but it was these or nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments afterward, they climbed the
high gangway ladder and passed through two
lines of saluting sailors. The officer of the
deck of the &#8220;Connecticut,&#8221; a lieutenant, stood
civilly by to receive the foreign officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Mr. Perry,&#8221; he gasped, wringing
the lad&#8217;s hand gladly. &#8220;Whatever are you
doing in those togs? We had given all three
of you up for dead,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The admiral
and Captain Taylor will be mighty
glad to see you. We are flag-ship now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads descended to their room, while
O&#8217;Neil was escorted forward by a worshiping
crowd of shipmates.</p>

<p>The boys discarded their foreign uniforms
and donning their simple midshipman&#8217;s
clothes were ready to report their return to
their commanding officer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>In a few minutes they entered the cabin.
Captain Taylor&#8217;s face was smiling with joy as
he, almost embracing the midshipmen, introduced
them to the commander-in-chief, Admiral
Spotts. The boys were abashed in the
presence of such an important personage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, this is indeed a happy moment,&#8221;
Captain Taylor exclaimed. &#8220;Before
the cruisers were sighted entering the harbor
we were about to cable to the Navy Department
the news of your deaths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our deaths, sir!&#8221; cried both lads aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Captain Taylor explained. &#8220;We
heard four days ago that the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217; had
been sunk with all on board. The leader of
the rebellion, General Ruiz, gave out the news
as received by cable from Rio Grande. We
have tried to catch you by wireless but not
receiving any answer to our call, we feared
the news was authentic. He also issued an
ultimatum that La Boca would be blockaded&mdash;Admiral
Spotts with his squadron was ordered
here from the West Indies and arrived
but an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aquadores&#8217; sunk!&#8221; exclaimed Phil.
&#8220;Why should he give such information?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>&#8220;What did happen? Tell us,&#8221; questioned
the admiral eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Aquadores&#8217; sunk the &#8216;Soledad&#8217; and
torpedo-boat and captured the &#8216;Barcelo,&#8217;&#8221;
Phil replied proudly, then he described all
that had happened since they had left the
&#8220;Connecticut.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two officers listened in silence at the
lad&#8217;s story, told simply and modestly. He
bestowed unstinted praise on his two companions,
barely mentioning the important
part that he himself had played, which
brought from Sydney an unselfish protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, sir, was everything to us,&#8221;
Sydney interrupted, his face flushed with joy
at his companion&#8217;s praises for him.</p>

<p>When Phil had told of the part they had
taken in the sea fights, the admiral could
contain himself no longer; he felt his boyhood
blood once more flowing through his
veins; he had in his youth taken part in
many a fight during the long Civil War.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our only excuse,&#8221; Phil ended contritely,
&#8220;is that we acted in self-defense.&#8221;</p>

<p>The admiral chuckled gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Self-defense,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;You young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
rascals, you did it for the love of fighting.
Now own up to it! If you had done otherwise
I&#8217;d have had you all court-martialed.&#8221;
He lowered his voice. &#8220;You have done a
great service to your country; when the news
of the sinking of the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217; reached
Europe, three countries there acknowledged
the rebels as belligerents, which gave General
Ruiz the temerity to declare the blockade.
If this is established our country&#8217;s commercial
interests will suffer to the extent of many millions
of dollars a day. My orders are if the
rebel war-ships attempt to stop our merchantmen
from entering or leaving this port to put
an end to the blockade by force, and you see
I have the force,&#8221; he added smiling. &#8220;But
why did you not send us a wireless instead of
keeping us in this suspense?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t, sir,&#8221; Phil explained; &#8220;our
wireless was totally wrecked in the first engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads were indeed happy. Instead of
being punished for their acts, the admiral
was praising them. They dared not look at
each other; they feared they would shout out
with excess of joy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;For the present of course everything
must be kept secret,&#8221; the admiral cautioned,
rising to depart, &#8220;but bear in mind, I shall
not forget your valuable services.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded to the captain and smiled at
the joyous lads; then passed into his own
cabin, leaving the midshipmen alone with
Captain Taylor.</p>

<p>Phil asked the question which had been
trembling on his lips during all the time the
admiral was talking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the arms, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are safe in the legation,&#8221; the captain
replied gladly; &#8220;you were grossly misinformed
by that scoundrel Juarez. As soon as
your cipher message was translated, I took
Mr. Penfield with me and we went ashore to
the legation. We saw Mr. Lazar and showed
him your message. He took us immediately
to the cellar of the minister&#8217;s residence and
pointed out the boxes, all intact; he opened
for us the box which you had half opened on
the launch the night of the capture; the
arms were in plain view. It was but a plot
of the rebels to make you betray the arms to
them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>&#8220;Where are the rebel lines?&#8221; Phil asked,
unconvinced; &#8220;have they approached nearer
to the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Captain Taylor answered, &#8220;the two
armies are now intrenched with but a scant
one thousand yards between them. General
Ruiz threatens to assault the city momentarily.
We believed he was awaiting his war-ships to
shell the government forces from inside the
harbor; but your story disproves that conjecture
unless he himself has been misled.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads soon left the cabin and went into
their own mess room. Their return was
hailed with enthusiasm, but neither had ears
for praise; there was still work in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think, Syd,&#8221; asked Phil,
on reaching the quiet of their room, &#8220;are the
arms in the legation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain says he saw them,&#8221; replied
Sydney thoughtfully. &#8220;How could he be mistaken?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It surely seems very strange,&#8221; declared
the other, &#8220;why both Juarez and General
Ruiz should tell us they were not in the
legation but safe in the city ready to be
brought into the rebel lines. Ruiz thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
himself safe in telling us this for he had no
idea we could escape. It was purely providential
that the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217; came along.
Even if he hadn&#8217;t shot us, he surely would
have kept us close prisoners. We knew too
much to be set free.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning the lads went to see
Captain Taylor. They had thought the
matter over during the evening and had
lain awake thinking about it a good part
of the night; they were no nearer a solution
of the vexing problem.</p>

<p>Captain Taylor received them with his
usual kindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; Phil commenced as spokesman,
&#8220;please do not believe us incredulous always,
but the idea that the guns are elsewhere than
in the legation has taken such a hold on us
that we have come to ask you to take us to
the legation with you this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Taylor looked puzzled. He realized
the lads were in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;If it will ease
your minds, of course I shall take you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ordered his boat and the boys found
themselves shortly climbing Legation Hill on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
the way to the residence of the American
minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure,&#8221; spoke Captain Taylor while
they climbed the steep streets, &#8220;that your
doubts will soon be set at rest. Mr. Lazar
is a careful officer; he has shown me how
he has placed his guards and it seems impossible
that the arms could be taken without
detection. The guns, I explained before,
are in the cellar. There is but one exit, a
stairway leading up to the ground floor.
At the top of the stairs is a door and there
two sentinels are posted night and day.
Machinist&#8217;s Mate Craig, the man who was
wounded in your expedition, sleeps on a cot
in the cellar within reach of the boxes. So
you see how well they have been guarded?
The full force of the guard are encamped on
the grounds of the legation and are ready for
instant call.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney exchanged knowing
glances. Craig&mdash;Lazar&#8217;s tool! The arms
were surely not in the legation!</p>

<p>Lazar met them at the gate and saluted
the captain. He bowed to the lads in mock
courtesy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>&#8220;I am delighted,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to see you
are safe.&#8221; He did not offer his hand. He
doubtless knew it would be ignored by the
midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lazar,&#8221; Captain Taylor began merrily,
&#8220;Mr. Perry and Mr. Monroe wish to be convinced
that we still hold the guns securely, so
I have brought them to feast their eyes on
their captured arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir,&#8221; replied Lazar smartly,
leading the way into the legation.</p>

<p>The boys were welcomed by both Marshall
and Morrison, who would have plied them
with many anxious questions, but the lads
were too impatient to see the boxes in the
cellar of the legation.</p>

<p>The minister received the captain cordially.
The latter explained his mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have had a look below there,&#8221;
the minister said, &#8220;I would like to see you
in the office. I have news that may interest
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reaching the cellar the lads saw Craig,
looking pale and haggard, standing beside the
boxes. He gave them a quick glance in
which Phil thought he read terror. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
seen that same look on many human faces
in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>Lazar picked up a hatchet and bared the
contents of a box.</p>

<p>The lads peered in. There were the Colt
guns: two barrels, two tripods and the accessory
boxes.</p>

<p>Phil glanced up and caught Lazar&#8217;s eye.
The latter smiled confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you satisfied?&#8221; he asked, a sneer in
his voice.</p>

<p>Phil reached for the hatchet, but Lazar ignored
the motion and stepping away stood
beside Captain Taylor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man of yours, Lazar,&#8221; said the latter
in a low voice, &#8220;should not be made to sleep
in this damp hole any longer. He seems to
show the effects greatly. I believe I shall
order him back to the ship. You can pick
out another reliable man to take his place
and change them often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall relieve him immediately, sir, but,
with your permission, I would like to retain
him with me. He is a valuable man to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have it your own way,&#8221; the captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
agreed, &#8220;but don&#8217;t let him sleep there any
longer; he appears a sick man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil watched Captain Taylor and Lazar
move slowly up the steps. The former threw
an inquiring glance over his shoulder at the
lads standing determinedly in the cellar.
The officers disappeared and the midshipmen
heard their footsteps enter the minister&#8217;s
office above.</p>

<p>Phil turned a glance full of pity on Craig.
The sailorman shook as if with ague.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ill?&#8221; asked Phil in sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I don&#8217;t want to stay here any
longer,&#8221; the miserable man pleaded. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you, sir, get me back on board ship?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil noticed the unhealthy pallor on the
man&#8217;s cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a cough?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only lately, sir, but it seems to get
worse,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Sydney had been rummaging about in the
cellar; he now appeared with a piece of bar
steel pointed on the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s open another box, Phil,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>After a few minutes the cover of a box was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
pried open. The lads gave a gasp of surprise.
It contained only rocks. Another and another
lid was forced, until the last box was
opened to the light. Not one contained arms
but were piled to the top with rocks; only
the one examined by Lazar held arms.</p>

<p>Craig was stupefied with terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish to save yourself,&#8221; Phil
whispered, turning upon the frightened
sailor, &#8220;tell us where the guns have been
taken. We know you have been forced to
do this work.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s knees shook and his voice failed
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll kill me if I tell,&#8221; he whined pitifully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he won&#8217;t,&#8221; Phil hastily assured him.
&#8220;We shall tell him nothing. We promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were taken through this underground
passageway to the next house,&#8221; Craig
replied in a terrified whisper, showing the
cleverly concealed opening to a secret tunnel
underneath the cellar floor; &#8220;they are now
in Mr. Juarez&#8217;s house at La Mesa. I overheard
the order given to hide them there.&#8221;</p>



<p>The lads had discovered quite enough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
They ascended the steps and walked excitedly
to the minister&#8217;s office.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_240.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;YOU SEIZED ONLY A CARGO<br />
OF ROCKS&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Captain Taylor at once noticed the agitation
on their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he inquired in
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please come with us, sir,&#8221; Phil begged
in as calm a voice as he could muster.</p>

<p>The captain and Lazar followed the midshipmen
back to the cellar.</p>

<p>A cry of surprise escaped from Captain
Taylor when he saw the contents of the remaining
boxes.</p>

<p>Lazar&#8217;s face was a study. A cynical smile
curled his mouth. His manner was calm.
He held himself perfectly under control.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear the rebels were too cunning for
you, Mr. Perry,&#8221; he said casting a look, full
of hatred, at the midshipman. &#8220;You
thought you had arms, but you seized only
a cargo of rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the one box,&#8221; exclaimed Captain
Taylor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a clever ruse, I presume,&#8221; Lazar
explained promptly; &#8220;that one was placed on
the launch in just such a manner as a card<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
trickster forces on you a card from his pack.
It was the logical one to open. The remaining
arms are probably by now in the hands
of the insurgents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both lads gasped at the scoundrel&#8217;s deceit,
and hot words came in their thoughts, but
their promise to Craig held them unspoken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>THE HOUSE ON LA MESA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Taylor</span> was quite satisfied upon
hearing Lazar&#8217;s ready explanation. The
thought that the latter was aught but the
honorable, efficient officer that he appeared
never entered his generous mind. He gazed
at the lads with compassion on his kindly
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a great disappointment,&#8221; he
said to the silent, stunned lads. &#8220;You have
worked so hard and then to be hoodwinked
by the villainous cunning of the vice-consul
must indeed be hard. But never mind, his
just retribution will overtake him if the government
is successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>In silence they ascended the stairs and entered
the minister&#8217;s office. That official had
just received news that seemed to put him in
an excited state of mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain, I was just about to tell you when
you so hastily left me a moment ago,&#8221; he began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
rapidly, &#8220;that I have received reliable
information that General Ruiz at last is going
to make a determined assault on the city.
My informant says the force of the attacking
army will be concentrated on Tortuga Hill;
it is a high, round-top hill to the right of the
city. This appears to be the key to the situation
and is now well fortified. I want your
advice as to whether I shall give the information
to the president in order that his general
may be prepared to defend that position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly,&#8221; Captain Taylor replied
at once, showing in his calm face a spark of
excitement. &#8220;The admiral&#8217;s orders are, you
know, to uphold the government; we have
thrown our fortune into the scale against the
rebels. When will the assault take place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That my informant does not know,&#8221; answered
the minister, &#8220;but he believes it will
be very soon, perhaps to-day or to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From whom does this information come,
sir?&#8221; hazarded Phil, bluntly. His interest
was so intense that he quite forgot his teaching
that midshipmen should stay in the background
of their seniors&#8217; affairs.</p>

<p>The minister looked surprisedly at him;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
then his face beamed with pleasure as he
recognized the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, your work and that of your
companions has awakened our admiration,&#8221;
he exclaimed, shaking the boy&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I
trust you will not again prove that my information
is wrong;&#8221; he smiled ruefully;
&#8220;the man who brings me this is a member of
a rich and powerful business firm. He has
too much at stake to afford to see the city
given over to the lawless army of General
Ruiz and yet he dares not take his information
to the government for fear of the rebel
sympathizers within the city; so he has
brought it to me and begged me to see that
it was received at once at the president&#8217;s
palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The explanation sounded plausible; yet
there was a flaw. Could this man be a member
of the firm of La Fitte and Company?
Did the minister suspect that Juarez had
been hand and glove with this firm? Phil
thought he saw the trick; if the arms were
on La Mesa then there would be the assault.
General Ruiz, or more likely Juarez, had sent
this information in order that the greater part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
of the government force would be removed to
Tortuga Hill and away from the real objective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall send the despatch immediately,&#8221;
the minister added, addressing Captain
Taylor. &#8220;Will you notify Admiral Spotts as
to what I have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was strongly tempted to stop the
despatch by telling of the arms, when he
remembered he could not do this without
bringing to a crisis his enmity with Lazar;
but of the latter&#8217;s evil deeds he had no proofs.</p>

<p>Shortly the captain, Sydney and Phil left
the legation and walked toward the landing-pier
to take their boat back to the ship.</p>

<p>After their arrival on board, the boys got
the chart of La Boca from the navigator and
studied the surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is La Mesa,&#8221; Phil exclaimed, pointing
with his finger, &#8220;and here is Tortuga Hill.
Nowhere near each other. Do you see the
ruse, Syd? La Mesa will be the main point
of attack, for if they can take that hill they
will have the machine guns. Then with
these guns mounted they can command the
city from behind and where the cruiser&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
guns can do but little damage; while Tortuga
Hill is near enough to the sea for the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217;
to shell the rebels out if they were
fortunate enough to capture it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; pondered Sydney,
agreeing with his chum on every point.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s surely puzzling,&#8221; rejoined he; &#8220;we
might have stopped the message, but we
should have found ourselves very much involved
by so doing and I fear if we made our
charges against Lazar without being able to
furnish sufficient evidence, we would be in a
difficult position with both admiral and captain,
and besides would break our promise to
Craig.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few hours later they and their faithful
boatswain&#8217;s mate, having received the necessary
permission, were once more ashore. This
time they were in uniform, with heavy Colt
revolvers in their holsters. They trudged up
the hill back of the town, known to the
natives as La Mesa.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had been informed about the stolen
arms, and his keen judgment had suggested an
immediate and personal investigation of the
locality.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>The hill was steep but not high and but
sparsely inhabited. At the top they knew was
the residence of Juarez.</p>

<p>On reaching the summit they gazed about
them. Further inland away from the city was
a second hill higher than La Mesa; in fact La
Mesa was not a hill but a flat spur of the hill
in front. On top of the latter they could see
a battery of loyal artillery. To their right
and left the lines of the defenders were in
sight, each prominent point well supplied
with men and guns. Far away to their left
rose Tortuga Hill, and trailing up its steep
slope were visible small objects which the lads
knew were re&euml;nforcements.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reserves,&#8221; Phil exclaimed pointing to
the turtle shaped hill; &#8220;the minister&#8217;s message
has arrived and is being acted upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil had left the lads deep in the study
of the strategic positions of the defense and
was bent on investigating the houses on the
table-like hill. He entered the garden of a
prosperous looking building and strolled
slowly toward the house; knocking loudly
on the door, he waited, listening for footsteps
within. He heard a sound of some one moving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
about and then a hurried whispering. A
few moments and the door was opened slowly;
a man&#8217;s face peered through the narrow slit.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; the man asked
gruffly in Spanish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Se&ntilde;or Juarez live here?&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
asked in the same tongue.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face blanched and he would have
closed the door, but the sailor&#8217;s heavily booted
shoe had wedged it open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; he added sternly; &#8220;answer
my question.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man stared, an angry scowl on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not here,&#8221; he snarled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you if he lived here,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil corrected,
wedging the door further open with the
powerful force of his body, &#8220;not if he was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of whispering from behind the
door caused his hand to go quickly to his
revolver holster. The door suddenly swung
open and the sailor found himself inside in
inky darkness. The door had closed with a
snap behind him.</p>

<p>He held his revolver in his hand, his finger
on the trigger, his ears straining to locate an
enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>He heard a noise behind him and swinging
around fired directly toward the sound. The
flash of his pistol lit up the dark hall for the
fraction of a second, but before he could seek
a protecting wall he was struck heavily from
behind and his senses left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;A shot, did you hear it?&#8221; cried Sydney
swinging about in the direction of the cluster
of buildings. &#8220;Why, where&#8217;s O&#8217;Neil?&#8221; he
added in alarm, noting that the sailor was nowhere
in sight.</p>

<p>With an apprehension of coming evil they
walked hastily toward the building from
which they had heard the report of fire-arms.</p>

<p>Phil uttered a cry of dismay and ran up the
steps of the large house.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s hat,&#8221; he cried, a terrible dread in
his voice. &#8220;There&#8217;s been foul play here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Juarez&#8217;s house,&#8221; said Sydney aghast, &#8220;and
O&#8217;Neil is inside alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked about for assistance. There
was none nearer than the foot of the hill,
where a company of infantry were encamped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; questioned Sydney
in despair. &#8220;They may murder him; and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
we attempt to force an entrance they could
dispatch us without fear of detection and we
would do O&#8217;Neil no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; cried Phil clutching his companion&#8217;s
arm and dragging him away. &#8220;You
go down to that camp and ask for aid. I shall
stay here and keep guard. They undoubtedly
thought he was alone, and if they haven&#8217;t already
seen us we may surprise them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney found the soldiers only too willing
to aid them and he soon returned with a
lieutenant and thirty men.</p>

<p>Phil quickly explained the situation. The
lieutenant stationed his men about the house,
surrounding it on all sides.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney knocked heavily on the
door; there was no answer. They tried to
force it, but it was of stout material and doubly
barred on the inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;A battering ram,&#8221; Sydney cried. The
willing soldiers soon brought a huge log of
wood and after a few minutes&#8217; pounding the
door flew inward in pieces.</p>

<p>With drawn revolvers and followed by a
file of soldiers they entered the gloom of the
house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>The lads cast bewildered looks about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blood,&#8221; cried Phil aghast, pointing a
trembling finger at a dark stain on the
polished floor.</p>

<p>He raised his hand for silence; but there
was no sound audible save the beating of their
own hearts and the heavy breathing of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Each floor of the house was searched diligently,
but no trace could be found of the
missing sailor; the house was empty of human
beings.</p>

<p>The boys were quite overwhelmed at the
suddenness of the blow; O&#8217;Neil was perhaps
done to death almost within sound of their
voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men who have done this deed must
yet be in the house,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed;
&#8220;they could not have escaped without detection;
there must be a secret chamber.
We must hunt for it; we cannot give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despairingly the searchers moved about
from room to room, tapping the wall and
floor in a vain effort to discover the door
they felt sure must be there concealed; their
exertions were for naught.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>The lads finally came back to the telltale
signs on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; cried Phil excitedly, putting
his finger on a large hole in the plastered wall.
&#8220;We heard the shot; it was from O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s revolver,
and there&#8217;s where it struck. If he fired
at a man then that&#8217;s his blood there on the
floor, not O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s; he never misses his aim;
that bullet must have gone through a man&#8217;s
chest; it&#8217;s just the right height.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll catch them,&#8221; Sydney cried, a
ring of hope in his voice, &#8220;for they can&#8217;t go
far with a wounded man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had dropped to his knees on the floor
and examined the blood tracks carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see?&#8221; he said to Sydney, close
beside him, his voice low but excited, &#8220;the
blood stops here. The wounded man stood
here for a number of seconds, you can see
that by the quantity of blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pounded the board with his bare fist;
but it gave back a solid sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit that board again,&#8221; cried Sydney, his
eyes intent on the edge next the wall near
him.</p>

<p>Phil struck the board a resounding blow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Its edge moved ever so slightly. Sydney
grasped a bayonet from a soldier and entered
its sharp point between the edge of the board
and the wall.</p>

<p>In but a moment the board had been removed
and the lads peered down into a black
pit from which the damp smell of earth came
up to their nostrils.</p>

<p>The silence was breathless. The first to
enter might be killed instantly by the enemy
cornered like rats in the dark hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light, quick,&#8221; whispered Phil to a wide-eyed
soldier.</p>

<p>One was soon brought and lowered into the
yawning chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cellar,&#8221; exclaimed Phil from his
knees, his head peering beneath the level of
the floor; &#8220;we must go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers brought a rope and
knotted it; the dangling end led down to the
earth floor of the cellar.</p>

<p>The boys with revolvers tightly grasped
descended quickly, their hearts beating
wildly, until their feet struck the earth
twenty feet below them.</p>

<p>The light from above threw a glimmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
about the mouldy cavern. There was no
one there.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guns,&#8221; Sydney whispered suddenly,
clutching Phil&#8217;s arm and pointing to a corner
of the cellar. There was a large pile of some
objects covered carefully with canvas. A
closer observation showed Sydney was right.
The machine guns and many boxes of ammunition
were stored under that large expanse
of canvas.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and five of his men slid
down on the rope, their rifles rattling menacingly;
the other men remained at the top of
the hole ready to haul the men up from below
when necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;The blood leads down that tunnel,&#8221; Phil
cried in alarm. &#8220;Two men could stand off
two dozen in that place&mdash;but we must attempt
it. Come on, Syd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carrying the light they cautiously advanced,
the soldiers slowly bringing up the
rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;A door,&#8221; Sydney whispered as the dim
light of the lantern showed the tunnel ending
in a heavy partition of wood.</p>

<p>Calling the soldiers forward, the party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
flung themselves against the door, but it
had doubtless been built for just such a purpose
and withstood each successive attempt.</p>

<p>Some of the men went back for the battering
ram while the lads examined the door closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is blood on the door,&#8221; Phil cried,
showing the fresh red stains on his hand
from contact with the door. &#8220;But where
does it lead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it goes into the next house,&#8221;
cried Sydney, &#8220;and they&#8217;ll get away from us.
Tell the lieutenant to order his men to surround
both houses on each side.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant, evidently not relishing this
uncertain way of attack in a dark cellar
with but a poor and inefficient lamp, agreed
readily to go back himself to see that both
houses were covered by his men.</p>

<p>It seemed an age to the anxious lads until
the soldiers returned with the heavy log.</p>

<p>&#8220;All hands now,&#8221; cried Phil, he and
Sydney laying willing hands on the ram.
&#8220;Together; there she goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door shivered but stood firm. Again
and again the log was launched against the
heavy door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>With sweat pouring from their bodies, their
lungs choked with dust, they put forth their
entire strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s giving,&#8221; cried Phil, as the ram struck
the door a powerful blow, and it gave way
suddenly, throwing them face downward on
the earth.</p>

<p>A flash of a pistol almost in their faces; a
sharp report echoing deafeningly in the
tunnel, and all was darkness.</p>

<p>The lads on their hands and knees crawled
noiselessly to the side of the tunnel. The
lamp had been upset and had plunged the
tunnel into night. The soldiers&#8217; stumbling
footsteps as they retreated in a panic toward
the exit came to their ears. They strained
their eyes in the direction of the fallen door
but could see nothing. They knew their
enemies were near; the pistol flashed so close
above their heads that their nostrils were
stung with the pungent fumes of burnt
powder.</p>

<small>THE DEFENSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lads dared not move. Even their
breathing might attract the attention of
their enemies, ready to open fire at the first
sound; their number they could but conjecture;
O&#8217;Neil had not been overpowered
by only one man, they felt sure.</p>

<p>Down on their hands and knees in darkness
so intense that they could not see an
inch before their eyes they waited, with bated
breath, for they knew not what.</p>

<p>Suddenly a noise in front of them awakened
their failing hopes. A faint glimmer of light,
only enough to penetrate the inky veil of
night, came through an opening beyond the
fallen door. An excited whisper in Spanish
caught their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;The houses are surrounded by those
miserable soldiers; they haven&#8217;t the courage
to attack us themselves, but these meddling
Americans fear nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>&#8220;They seem to fear something, judging by
their hasty retreat just now in face of my
revolver,&#8221; another voice replied in a louder
tone. &#8220;We have cut the claws of one of
them at least and if the Americans return
down the tunnel they&#8217;ll find us prepared to
give them a hot reception.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart leaped to his throat; it was
the voice of Colonel Juarez. How badly
had O&#8217;Neil been injured? This man was
quite capable of making away with him entirely
if it would serve his ends.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not stay here,&#8221; the first speaker
declared; &#8220;you should go at once to General
Ruiz&#8217;s lines and tell him how I am situated.
He must attack immediately; if he delays
the arms may fall into our enemy&#8217;s hands
through the aid of these Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I escape capture?&#8221; Juarez
asked; &#8220;even if I could avoid the soldiers, I
could not pass through the government lines
without challenge; if it were night it might
be possible, but by sunset the attack will
have begun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is now but two o&#8217;clock,&#8221; urged the
other, &#8220;and if I am captured here I shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
killed. The president would have me shot
immediately as a traitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could readily explain your mission
here,&#8221; replied Juarez&#8217;s voice, &#8220;you, who have
been so loyal to the government cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be impossible,&#8221; said the first
speaker, anxiously; &#8220;if the arms are found
here and afterward the plan of battle shows
that Ruiz massed his attacking column on
this hill when I have informed the American
minister that Tortuga Hill was the real objective,
you see how black a case they
would have against me. One small seed of
suspicion sown at this time and I am lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the president doesn&#8217;t know that you
gave this information to the minister,&#8221; retorted
Juarez.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the other voice promptly, &#8220;the
minister would be quick to clear himself by
informing on me. The arms must not be
taken. You must go at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I must risk my life to save yours; is
that it?&#8221; questioned Juarez bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in my pay; why shouldn&#8217;t you
take this risk? If I lose, the money for your
work can never be paid.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>There was silence for some minutes. Phil
had almost made up his mind to crawl back
down the tunnel, but he realized instantly
that the noise they could not avoid making
would draw their enemies&#8217; fire and defeat his
design of getting the soldiers to again enter
the tunnel and charge room beyond.</p>

<p>His better course was to remain where he
was. If they attacked they might injure their
companion who was there with these two
scheming villains.</p>

<p>The first speaker&#8217;s voice sounded again
after the pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here in my automobile. Can you
run it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Juarez promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My chauffeur is awaiting me at the foot of
La Mesa near Sanchez&#8217;s Villa,&#8221; continued the
other. &#8220;If you could reach the car you could
run the guards on the El Poso road. Just before
you get to the outpost slow the machine
as if you were stopping; then throw in the
high gear and advance the spark to the limit.
The soldiers will be too astonished to hit you
even if they fire, and you will be in safety
before they can fire more than one shot each.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>&#8220;Where is Pedro?&#8221; asked Juarez. &#8220;You
and he must remain here and guard the arms.
As long as you fire down the tunnel the
soldiers will be afraid to enter the cellar. The
American midshipmen will urge them to return,
but your shots will prevent their courage
from returning into their yellow hearts. I
am sick of these natives; they must be driven
like sheep. The more I see of their valor the
more I am convinced that the city is ours if
we can gain and mount these machine guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro and I shall remain here,&#8221; the other
answered; &#8220;he is not badly wounded; it is but
a flesh wound on the arm. He is now above
in the other house watching the soldiers from
one of the windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me with this American pig,&#8221; Juarez&#8217;s
voice said cruelly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put on his uniform,
and if I am fortunate enough not to meet one
of the Americans I can deceive the soldiers;
they do not know me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads heard O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s unresisting body
dragged about and knew that Juarez was
divesting the sailor of his uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to finish him,&#8221; said Juarez
savagely, but the other objected.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t waste your time on him, every
second is precious; they may return any
moment. He&#8217;s thoroughly stunned, and I
can take care of him if he comes to.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the speaker&#8217;s voice was stilled, the lads
heard footsteps. The faint light died into
blackness. They were glad to know that
O&#8217;Neil was not seriously hurt, but the thought
that Juarez might escape and hasten the attack
before the machine guns could be
rescued stirred them to the highest pitch of
anxiety. They listened intently, but could
hear nothing save the beating of their own
hearts. Undoubtedly Juarez had gone, but
the other man was surely there on guard, and
soon the man called Pedro would join him.</p>

<p>Phil dared not speak; he felt immediate
action was needed. Suddenly an inspiration
came to him. He slowly and cautiously
moved his hand toward where he knew his
companion must be, until it rested over
Sydney&#8217;s fingers. Then pressing firmly as if
his friend&#8217;s hand were a telegraph key, he
signaled the one word in the naval code:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion understood and answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
by a steady pressure of the hand, then followed
Phil slowly and painfully over the
fallen door. They dared not breathe; they
must now be within arm&#8217;s length of their
enemy. Sydney&#8217;s hand touched Phil. The
shock of his cold touch made the overwrought
lad spring to his feet, pointing his
revolver menacingly. A second and the
situation was grasped. They were alone in
the tunnel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get O&#8217;Neil and hurry. The
men may return any moment and we must
avoid a fight,&#8221; whispered Phil.</p>

<p>By the sound of the sailor&#8217;s breathing they
located his prostrate body. They lifted him
carefully and picked their way back over the
fallen door. They reached the opening in the
cellar, thankful at saving their shipmate from
the hands of these men, who would have
killed him without pity if it served their
ends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go up first, Syd,&#8221; commanded Phil. Sydney
hesitated, casting an apprehensive glance
down the dark tunnel. If the men came back
they could see Phil by the light from the opening
above.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>&#8220;Stand back,&#8221; Sydney urged, &#8220;until I am
ready to help you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney ascended quickly. Phil made the
rope fast around the body of the unconscious
man, and Sydney slowly hauled O&#8217;Neil to
safety.</p>

<p>Phil was alone in the blackness of the
cellar. He strove against the fear of an unknown
danger. It seemed an age before the
rope was free and came swiftly back to him.</p>

<p>In but a moment they emerged from the
house with their burden into the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the soldiers?&#8221; questioned Sydney
anxiously. They placed the unconscious
sailor on the soft earth and looked quickly
about them. There was not a soldier in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of Juarez&#8217;s work, you can be sure
of that,&#8221; replied Phil uneasily. &#8220;He took a
desperate risk impersonating O&#8217;Neil, and
probably told the soldiers they were no longer
needed, and the lieutenant was glad enough
to get back to the security of his camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had a half a dozen of our own
men,&#8221; Sydney declared; &#8220;we&#8217;d have those
guns safely out of that cellar in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Phil dropped down on his knees beside the
prostrate sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; he cried pointing to an ugly lump
on his head, &#8220;they stunned him by a blow
on the head. If we could get a doctor we&#8217;d
soon have him back to his senses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney had walked over to the brow of the
hill and peered below at the soldiers&#8217; camp.
He rushed back and caught Phil&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Phil, there he goes toward that group
of trees. He will reach the automobile and
once in it he can run the government lines.
Ruiz will attack immediately and the guns
will fall into his hands without a struggle.
How can we stop him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil had been too engrossed with the injuries
to O&#8217;Neil to think about the consequences
of Juarez&#8217;s escape. The ominous
meaning in his companion&#8217;s words brought
him back with a start to their dangerous
position.</p>

<p>Casting an anxious glance at the unfortunate
sailor he started down the hill, then
compassion for O&#8217;Neil made him return
quickly to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not abandon him here,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
cried. &#8220;Go, Syd, quick. You must get
down there and prevent Juarez&#8217;s escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney needed no further urging and Phil
saw him dart down the hill, but he also saw
the white figure of Juarez hastening toward
the waiting automobile.</p>

<p>Phil raised the stalwart form of O&#8217;Neil to
his shoulder and carried him slowly down
the hill. His burden was great, but he bore
it easily; thanks to his athletic training.
Sydney was now almost among the soldiers;
he saw them turn toward the approaching
midshipman, then go scurrying away after
the figure in O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s uniform.</p>

<p>Phil put forth his young strength and redoubled
his speed; a cry of despair escaped
him. A dark shape darted out of the grove
of trees and sped away along the road, leaving
a thick cloud of dust behind it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The automobile. Shoot!&#8221; he yelled at
the top of his lungs. Yet he knew his voice
could not be heard by the pursuing soldiers.
He fairly ran down the hill with the sailor&#8217;s
body securely on his shoulders. The sharp
crack of rifle shots came up to him from below.
The firing spread along the lines of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
defending army, but the lad saw with bitterness
that Juarez would not be stopped; the
machine was running at top speed down
the military road straight for the outpost at
El Poso.</p>

<p>Reaching the camp Phil laid his burden
on the soft grass. He was breathless with
his great exertions of the last few minutes.
His lungs seemed unable to get enough air.</p>

<p>The soldiers were returning from their
futile chase after Juarez.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, a doctor,&#8221; Phil ordered, his voice
betraying his great anxiety. La Mesa and
the arms now would surely be captured, and
Ruiz would take the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;A medico, se&ntilde;or?&#8221; questioned an officer,
eying the prostrate figure on the grass. Phil
caught him roughly by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a doctor?&#8221; he cried excitedly.
&#8220;This man has been stunned by a blow in
the head. Can you bring him to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no time to attend to the wounded
of the enemy,&#8221; the doctor replied, shaking
him off.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not an enemy,&#8221; Phil cried, tearing
off the insurgent coat of Juarez from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
scantily clad sailor; &#8220;he is an American, one
of my companions. We need his services
badly,&#8221; the lad begged, throwing a glance up
toward La Mesa.</p>

<p>&#8220;An American,&#8221; the doctor exclaimed in
genuine surprise, bending at once over the
senseless body. He then stood up and called
for his assistants and together they carried
him inside the hospital tent near by.</p>

<p>Phil, relieved of his charge, looked anxiously
about for the lieutenant. He saw him
returning with Sydney from their race after
the automobile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come quick, Syd, we want all these
soldiers,&#8221; he shouted, turning back up the
hill. The lieutenant waved his hand and
gave rapid orders to his men.</p>

<p>Side by side the midshipmen raced back
up the steep slope of La Mesa. Once at the
top they stopped and waited impatiently for
the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you told him of the machine
guns?&#8221; Phil questioned his companion
breathlessly.</p>

<p>Sydney nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he has orders to go immediately to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Tortuga Hill with his company, but he wished
to see the arms first.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were soon in the house peering down
into the dark cellar. The lads knew that
at least two of their enemy were guarding
the tunnel and would open fire at the first
man who descended the rope.</p>

<p>Sydney would have pushed his companion
aside but Phil anticipated him and grasping
the rope firmly he slid down until his feet
struck the earth floor.</p>

<p>A fusillade of shots came from the guarding
enemy; he felt the rush of air from a
bullet that grazed his cheek. He jumped
backward hastily against the wall and glanced
anxiously up at his companions. Sydney
was descending rapidly and was soon by his
side. Another volley came from down the
tunnel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down,&#8221; Phil urged the hesitating
soldiers; &#8220;don&#8217;t desert us, the arms are here,
see!&#8221; He grasped a gun from under the
canvas cover and dragged it out until the
light from above disclosed its character to the
wavering men above.</p>

<p>The enemy in the tunnel opened a rapid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
fire; the soldiers ready to descend drew back
in fear. In desperation Phil drew his revolver
and faced squarely down the dark
tunnel; six shots from his Colt rang out.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are coming, se&ntilde;or,&#8221; the lieutenant
cried, forcing some of his men before him
down the rope and following them quickly,
while the lads silenced the fire of the enemy
with their revolvers.</p>

<p>The soldiers once in the cellar opened fire
with their rifles down the tunnel.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guns, now,&#8221; cried Phil; &#8220;two soldiers
must keep up the fire,&#8221; he directed turning to
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The canvas cover was removed and a great
store of ordnance material was revealed to
the astonished eyes of the lieutenant and his
men.</p>

<p>They needed no further urging, but with
willing hands carried the machine guns from
the end of the cellar to the hole in the floor
above; the lads quickly knotted the rope
about their steel barrels and thirty guns were
soon safely landed on the floor of the hallway
of the house. Then the ammunition,
box after box, each containing six hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
rounds, was brought out by the men and
passed up to their companions above.</p>

<p>This task completed, the lads, ordering the
soldiers up the rope, fired a few parting shots
down the tunnel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must watch for the other man,&#8221; Phil
said, turning to Sydney as they emerged from
the house. &#8220;We know now that he is the
member of the firm of La Fitte and Company
who has been financiering this revolution;
and that it was he who confided the supposed
plan of attack to our minister; if we can lay
hands on him the end of the rebellion will be
in sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The astonishment on the soldiers&#8217; faces upon
seeing the machine guns which their ten
companions had passed out to them from the
house was almost ludicrous, but our lads
could give no thought now to the drollness
of the situation. Juarez had undoubtedly
reached the rebel lines in safety; by now
orders were being sent from Ruiz&#8217;s headquarters
to attack immediately instead of
waiting for sunset. The government, acting
upon the information from the minister,
given in good faith, had strengthened Tortuga<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
Hill to the disadvantage of all other points
of the defense. La Mesa was almost deserted.
Before the lads&#8217; bewildered eyes a mounted
aide rode at full gallop up to the battery on
the hill above them, shouting hurried orders.
They saw the battery limber up and charge
down the slope, disappearing along the
military road below them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, you must intercept that horseman,&#8221;
Phil cried pointing to the solitary figure but
a scant five hundred yards from them. &#8220;He
has ordered that battery away; he must be
told the seriousness of abandoning this hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney bounded away in pursuit. The
aide walked his horse down the slope, away
from La Mesa, surveying the scene about
him. He stopped and cast an enquiring
glance at those on the hill. Catching sight
of the approaching midshipman he wheeled
about to meet him. A moment later he had
dismounted at Phil&#8217;s side and with eyes full
of astonishment saw the machine guns and
the great store of ammunition.</p>

<p>Phil explained in a breath. The aide&#8217;s
swarthy face betrayed his fear for the results
of the expected assault.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>&#8220;You say the rebels will attack at once,&#8221;
he cried after the lad had finished his story;
&#8220;then this hill is lost. It will take an hour
to get sufficient force here to hold it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can hold it ourselves, if these men
will remain,&#8221; Phil declared stoutly. &#8220;But
the lieutenant has orders to leave us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; exclaimed the aide
incredulously; &#8220;how can you expect to hold
this hill with but a company of soldiers?
You have just said that General Ruiz will
concentrate his entire force here to obtain
these guns. We must retreat carrying these
guns with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to give the order, but
Phil raised his hand desperately to be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be unwise,&#8221; he cried earnestly.
&#8220;My companion and I can mount these guns.
We have ammunition here in abundance.
These thirty guns can hold La Mesa against
the rebel army.&#8221;</p>

<p>The aide&#8217;s face was a study. He knew
nothing about machine guns; and like all
ignorant men he believed the Americans were
deceiving him.</p>

<p>Phil thought quickly. If they retreated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
carrying the guns with them, the government
forces would be re&euml;nforced by their addition
but the rebel army was a match for them even
with this powerful acquisition. If they could
mount the guns and allow the rebel army to
assault La Mesa in ignorance of what was
awaiting them on the top, the rebel forces
would receive a check which would be a
terrible blow to their cause; the murderous
stream of lead would strike terror to the
simple unsuspecting hearts of their soldiers.
If he could but show the aide how important
it was to his cause to retain these men and
hold the hill!</p>

<p>Motioning Sydney, Phil bent over a gun,
raising it quickly to its tripod; adjusted the
firing mechanism deftly and wiped off the
heavy coating of preservative grease from its
intricate working parts. Sydney was busy at
a second gun. Phil stripped the cover from
a box of ammunition. His heart beat joyfully.
It was already loaded in the belts
ready to be run through the automatic
mechanism of the Colt gun&#8217;s breech. He
held up a long string of cartridges closely laid
within the &#8220;feed-tape.&#8221; He took the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
and with skilful fingers fed the first cartridge
to the steel maw of the gun; a string of
others trailed away along the tape to the box
beneath the breech of the gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;This gun is ready for action,&#8221; he cried,
turning anxiously to the surprised and delighted
aide. &#8220;This is worth a whole company
of soldiers and there are thirty more
waiting to be made ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay with these guns,&#8221; the aide ordered
as he precipitously dashed away. &#8220;I shall
send re&euml;nforcements.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads worked with trembling fingers.
Their anxiety nearly stifled them. The attack
might begin at any moment. They
knew that their soldier allies could not be
depended upon if the attack began before the
guns were ready.</p>

<p>They had just raised the last gun to its
tripod when the silence was disturbed by a
sullen boom of warning from Tortuga Hill:
the rebels were advancing.</p>

<small>THE ASSAULT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Battery</span> after battery within the government
lines opened fire. The Americans could
trace the points of defense by the red tongues
of flame and the smoke from the heavy guns.
The rattle of musketry spread along the line
like a prairie fire, but its volume was greatest
at Tortuga Hill. In a fever of excitement
they saw the rebel columns advance from
their protecting trenches; their heavy guns
now took part in the battle and sent their
shells over the heads of the advancing men
against the waiting government soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Divide your men,&#8221; Phil ordered the
lieutenant; &#8220;four for each gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>They saw the machine guns placed in positions
of vantage covering all directions from
which the attack must come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your fingers pressed on the triggers
and the guns pointed at the enemy,&#8221; Phil instructed
the anxious soldiers; &#8220;play the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
stream of bullets as if it were a hose, but for
your lives don&#8217;t shoot until I give the order.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldiers gazed in enchanted wonder at
the guns. They had never seen their like before.
They imagined they were something
almost supernatural. Had not the Americans
said one gun was equal to a company of
soldiers?</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Syd,&#8221; cried Phil in admiration,
pointing toward Tortuga Hill; the entire hillside
seemed alive with flashes of fire from
countless guns, but Phil&#8217;s finger pointed at a
horseman riding full gallop up the slope, shells
bursting all about his mount. &#8220;There is the
aide, but before re&euml;nforcements can reach us
the fight will be over. If the guns don&#8217;t jam
we can hold the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My fear is that our men will not stand
the preliminary shelling,&#8221; returned Sydney;
&#8220;all their guns are directed at Tortuga Hill
now, but when they have made their feint,
look out up here. We&#8217;ll have every gun
against us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our intrenchments are safe enough if the
men keep down in them,&#8221; Phil encouraged,
as they finished mounting the last gun and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
instructed its squad how to manipulate it,
&#8220;but if a panic takes them, they will not listen
to us. I wish we had O&#8217;Neil; his influence
with these natives is next to marvelous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything was now ready; the soldiers
had all been instructed how to fire and reload
a second tape of six hundred fresh cartridges.
All would go well if the soldiers&#8217; courage
could be depended upon to withstand the
searching fire of artillery which the lads
knew must soon commence.</p>

<p>The midshipmen viewed the appalling spectacle
with nervous eyes. Regiment after regiment
advanced from the cover of the trenches
in extended order and pressed forward silently,
the artillery behind them and on their flanks
sending its heavily charged shells screeching
over their heads to fall within the government
lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are surely concentrating on Tortuga
Hill,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed, hardly able to believe
his eyes, as he saw masses of khaki clad
men emerge from the dense foliage of the level
country and sweep upward toward that almost
impregnable position.</p>

<p>&#8220;They surely do not intend to assault that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
hill,&#8221; Phil exclaimed; &#8220;their loss would be
tremendous.&#8221; Then he rubbed his eyes, believing
that he must have been dreaming.
The first line of assault had vanished into the
earth. &#8220;Why, where did the first line go?&#8221;
he shouted excitedly, peering down at the remaining
columns as they swept silently forward.
In but a minute the last enemy had
disappeared from sight on the level plain. It
seemed like magic. The soldiers whispered
nervously to each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can it mean?&#8221; Sydney gasped as
they gazed in wonder at this remarkable illusion.
&#8220;Look out,&#8221; he cried, as a shrapnel
shell exploded over their heads, sending showers
of bullets all about them.</p>

<p>The artillery fire of the enemy redoubled,
and now every gun in the rebel army was concentrating
on La Mesa; bursting shell and
shrapnel were falling on every hand, and the
few defenders of the hill were in momentary
danger from their well aimed shooting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep down in the trenches,&#8221; the lads
warned the excited soldiers. A number had
already ventured out to satisfy their curiosity
and were stretched in their death agony behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
the trench. The midshipmen paced up
and down between their guns, apparently unconscious
of the death-dealing missiles about
them. Their one fear was that the men would
break and run before this terrible bombardment
was over.</p>

<p>Phil braved the storm of iron above his head
and took a comprehensive look at the panorama
before him. Something unusual was
happening on Tortuga Hill; its fire lessened,
and down the slope away from the enemy men
streamed in countless numbers. Officers could
be seen brandishing their swords and gesticulating
wildly. Was it a retreat? Phil&#8217;s heart
rose in his throat. A battery of field guns
galloped wildly away down the hill; it reached
the level country; the enemy saw its intention
and opened upon it a scathing fire. Yet
on it came heading directly for La Mesa.</p>

<p>The midshipmen cried out for joy and
pointed out the nearing aid to their terrorized
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady your men,&#8221; Phil urged the lieutenant;
&#8220;re&euml;nforcements are coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cry from Sydney at his side made his
hopes sink.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;There they come,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;We can
never stop them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Phil took in the situation his blood
seemed to freeze in his veins. From the woods
in front of La Mesa a swarm of men broke
cover and pressed forward on a run. While
as if from the ground, midway between them
and La Mesa, a seething fire of musketry swept
over the handful of defenders.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have the whole rebel army against us
now,&#8221; he whispered to Sydney, fearing his
men might hear this terrifying intelligence.
&#8220;It was a trench. They moved in it by the
flank and are now in front of us. They must
have known this on Tortuga Hill when we
saw them hurry our re&euml;nforcements to us. If
we can hold our men fifteen minutes longer
we&#8217;ll win.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad was right. The insurgents had, unobserved
by the defending army, dug a deep
trench during the night, half-way between the
two lines. The greater part of the assaulting
army had advanced on Tortuga Hill until they
had reached the shelter of this ditch, and then
had, protected from their enemy&#8217;s fire, moved
by the flank until they were directly in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
of and but five hundred yards from the top
of La Mesa. A withering fire came from the
concealed men; bullets like hail sang about
the Americans and their well-nigh demoralized
men. The government batteries were directing
a hot fire on the approaching masses; yet
on they came determinedly. Phil knew that
when the second column reached the trench
thousands of soldiers would storm up the few
hundred yards between them and their coveted prize,
La Mesa. Would the machine guns
have power to stem this irresistible host?</p>

<p>&#8220;How near will you let them come?&#8221; questioned
Sydney eagerly.</p>

<p>Phil estimated the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we fire as they leave the trench,
they might return to it and continue their
artillery to shell us out,&#8221; he answered quickly.
&#8220;It would be wiser to let them gain half the
distance before we let them know they have
the guns against them. They must see the
re&euml;nforcements coming to us from Tortuga
Hill, but they now believe the hill will be
theirs without a struggle before they can get
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen were at the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
pitch of excitement. They realized that the
fortunes of the government of Verazala
depended upon this assault. The insurgents&#8217;
brilliant strategy won their admiration.
With these Colt guns in their hands the
city would be theirs inside of twenty-four
hours. They knew that in these countries
a victory often means a complete rout for
the vanquished. Whole regiments have been
known to turn about, if the battle is seen
to be going against their side, and fight
with the enemy against their former comrades.</p>

<p>The batteries within range of the assaulting
columns opened a furious cannonade as
they saw the great surge of humanity leave
the newly made trench and charge boldly
up the slopes of La Mesa. Tortuga Hill
batteries opened a rapid fire, but the distance
was too great, their shells were opening
deep holes in the earth, but many yards
short of the attacking enemy.</p>

<p>The lads saw with anxiety that their men
were fighting desperately against the terror
which told them to flee; the awful, terrifying
horde of armed enemy were rushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
upon them with unnerving speed; they
knew the custom of their countrymen: they
gave &#8220;no quarter&#8221;; death approached them
on three sides.</p>

<p>The midshipmen pleaded with the men
to be calm; they even threatened them; but
their courage was fast slipping away. The
terrible sight of the thousands of their yelling
merciless enemies was too much for their
shaken nerves.</p>

<p>Then another sight brought a new fear to
the hearts of the despairing boys; the men
on the hill above them had abandoned their
guns and were retreating. Down the spur
of the hill they came. Their path led over
part of the trench in which the midshipmen
stood. The lads knew that this flood of fear
would sweep their own men along with it as
so much flotsam.</p>

<p>The time had arrived. Once the sound of
the magic guns had been heard the engulfing
tide might be turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open fire,&#8221; Phil shouted, his voice hoarse
with emotion.</p>

<p>The furious barking of the guns, sending
their leaden streams into the advancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
ranks brought back the waning courage of
the defending company.</p>

<p>The assaulting columns hesitated in their
mad rush for the hill. They saw their comrades
mowed down by the score. Where was
the easy victory their officers had told them
would be theirs? A horrible fear of treachery
came into their simple minds; they stopped.
No power could urge them a step further; in
another second they had broken and fled in
an ungovernable panic back to their trenches
for safety.</p>

<p>The men on La Mesa were wild with delight.
The lust of blood had entered their
souls. They became foolishly brave and
leaped upon the top of their protecting
trench, screaming malediction and defiance
at their routed enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get down,&#8221; the lads cried, grasping those
near them and dragging them forcibly to
shelter; but some had already paid the
penalty of their childlike, reckless bravado.
The enemy, once again secure in its trenches,
had opened a heavy fire on La Mesa.</p>

<p>Phil knew that the insurgents would attack
again. Ruiz would not be satisfied, even if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
he sacrificed every man, until the hill was
taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep cool,&#8221; the lads urged the excited
soldiers, moving among them and seeing
that the guns were reloaded with a full supply
of ammunition. &#8220;If you can hold
them once more our re&euml;nforcements will be
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rebels knew their time was short if
they would take the hill; they saw the
government reserves rapidly approaching to
succor their comrades on La Mesa.</p>

<p>Phil felt a touch on his shoulder, and turning
hastily, he looked into the revengeful
face of Lazar.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by fighting here,
wearing the uniform of the United States
navy?&#8221; Lazar began peremptorily. &#8220;Come
with me to the legation immediately, I command
you!</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear?&#8221; he continued in a voice
choking with wrath, as the lad showed no
signs of obedience. &#8220;I order you to leave
here and follow me. Both of you,&#8221; he added,
pointing toward the oblivious Sydney, who
was out of ear-shot at the far corner of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
intrenchment, gazing in awe at the battlefield
in front of them.</p>

<p>Phil sought the reason why Lazar was
there. It came to him suddenly; he saw it
all; it was not an accidental meeting; his
stained uniform showed he had ridden hard
to reach La Mesa. Juarez must have sent the
chauffeur to the legation with the news that
he and Sydney were on La Mesa, and Lazar
had arrived in the nick of time. If he
obeyed Lazar&#8217;s order and deserted the soldiers
while the enemy were about to make a desperate
assault, he knew that they would
break before the rebels got half-way to the
top, and the Colt guns would be lost. They
would see a new and terrible peril in being
deserted by the Americans. He could not
explain to them why he must leave them.
He saw in their eyes already an awakening
dread. The next assault would be desperate.
It had been the surprise at the defense of La
Mesa that had sent the enemy back to their
trenches in a panic. Now they knew with
what they had to deal, and the knowledge that
but a handful of men held the hill would
spur them on to redoubled energy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><i>&#8220;DO YOU REFUSE?&#8221; HE CRIED,<br />
HOARSELY</i></p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, do you realize that you are
deliberately disobeying my orders?&#8221; cried
Lazar in exasperation. &#8220;I am your superior
officer, in command of our forces on shore,
and I again order you both to come with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lazar, can&#8217;t you see the consequences
of deserting these men?&#8221; Phil questioned,
struggling to keep calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no concern for them,&#8221; answered
Lazar hotly. &#8220;You are wearing the United
States uniform and you are acting unadvisedly.
I order you to leave this hill at
once!&#8221; He was white with anger as he read
in Phil&#8217;s face determination to disobey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you refuse?&#8221; he cried hoarsely, his
hand moving almost unconsciously to his
revolver holster.</p>

<p>Excited cries from the soldiers made Phil
turn an anxious glance toward the enemy.
They were sweeping out of their trenches and
charging again up the hill. To leave now
could mean but failure to the government
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, sir, I must disobey your
order,&#8221; he said determinedly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Lazar&#8217;s revolver was now out of its holster.
His eyes blazed with anger and mortification.</p>

<p>&#8220;You defy me,&#8221; he roared, advancing
menacingly, holding his revolver in his
clenched hand.</p>

<p>Phil was so amazed that he could not find
voice to answer. Then his indignation at
the threatening attitude of his senior swept
caution aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I refuse to obey you,&#8221; he cried angrily.
&#8220;I shall not leave until the rebels are repulsed.&#8221;</p>

<p>His body trembling with passion, Phil
turned from the ensign toward the soldiers
standing uncertainly watching the enemy&#8217;s
approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, sir, begging your pardon, sir, but
that won&#8217;t do,&#8221; a familiar voice cried out
behind him. Phil glanced about quickly.
There was O&#8217;Neil, big and strong; he had
seized Lazar&#8217;s arm as he spoke and was forcing
his revolver back into its holster.</p>

<p>Lazar&#8217;s face was deadly white; he controlled
himself with difficulty. The soldiers
regarded the Americans anxiously, doubtlessly
realizing that their own safety depended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
upon the outcome of this clash of
authority.</p>

<p>Lazar gave Phil a look full of hatred, then
turned away and disappeared by the way he
had come.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had heard enough to fear
that the Americans might leave them. He
turned to Phil and begged him to remain.
The lad assured him that they would stand by
the guns.</p>

<p>The soldiers were experiencing the same
sensations that they had felt when their enemy
had commenced the first attack. Soldiers of
this stamp never become veterans.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil steadied them in his cheery voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you scared about?&#8221; he cried
loudly. &#8220;All you got to do is to put your black
fingers on the triggers; the guns will do the
rest. If you fire when you get the order the
rebels will not stop running until they strike
the next republic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Commence firing,&#8221; Phil ordered. The
Colt guns spit flame, sending countless messengers
of death into the rebel ranks.</p>

<p>On came the rebel hosts. Their ranks
broke sorely, but with determination born of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
despair they closed in the gaps and charged
onward.</p>

<p>The enemy&#8217;s artillery fire opened with redoubled
energy. Shell and shrapnel burst
with telling effect about the handful of men.
The trenches could not protect them. One
after another, the gun&#8217;s crews were depleted
by bursting shrapnel. Yet the little guns
spitefully ground out bullets from their heated
muzzles into the unprotected mass of humanity
now but a short distance from their
goal.</p>

<p>The ominous sounds of jammed and overheated
guns sent a thrill of dread through
the hearts of the Americans. What they
feared would happen was now taking place:
the guns were thickly coated with a grease to
preserve them in transit; there had been time
to remove but a small part of it before the
guns were fired; now this grease had become
mixed with the residue of burnt powder and
had formed a thick paste which clung to the
delicately fitting parts of the mechanism, thus
causing the guns to jam. Absolutely powerless
to remedy this fatal defect, the lads stood,
fear clutching at their hearts, hearing one gun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
after another cease its fire. But a handful of
guns remained in action. The horrified
soldiers were deserting, running away from
the avalanche sweeping upon them.</p>

<p>A few of the guns were still pumping a
leaden stream into the ranks of the rebels,
now but a hundred feet away, firing their
rifles as they came to keep up their fleeting
courage.</p>

<p>The Colt guns were stilled, the last soldier
had deserted; the Americans were alone in
the trench except for the dead and those too
badly wounded to escape from the terrifying
sound of the advancing army.</p>

<p>The silence of their enemy behind the intrenchments
on La Mesa sent a thrill of terror
through the advancing hundreds. Their dead
and dying behind them told them only too
plainly the power of these concealed guns.
They imagined the silence was but a trick to
draw them nearer, then hurl on them a
stream of bullets that would mow them down
like chaff before the reaper. Fifty yards
from the top of the hill they stood still, their
contorted faces white with a terrible fear.
Phil saw Juarez rush ahead of his demoralized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
men, urging them to advance. The glad
rattle of a Colt gun rang in the lad&#8217;s ears.
He saw O&#8217;Neil beside it; he had wiped out
the hard obstructing substance. The gun
again played its death-dealing stream on the
doubting enemy. The rebels, impelled from
behind, advanced slowly. Phil saw Juarez
sink to the ground; the tide of soldiers
streamed over his lifeless body; again they
wavered, then came on more determinedly
than ever. O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s gun jammed again with
an ominous click. The enemy were now only
a stone&#8217;s throw away from the trench; a few
seconds more and they would be pouring over
its top and butchering those who dared remain.
Phil grasped his revolver, and leaned
against the wall of earth behind him.</p>

<small>THE ACCUSATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Down</span> for your lives,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Neil, grasping
the benumbed lads, and dragging them to
the bottom of the trench.</p>

<p>A heavy fusillade of musketry from behind
them, a stamping of many feet in their rear,
then a swarm of humanity had pressed in close
to the almost empty trench and were emptying
the contents of their rifles at the surprised
enemy but a rod away.</p>

<p>The lads were filled with joy; the reserves
had arrived. Phil peered out between the
loyal rifles around him at the startled, disappointed
enemy; they had been sure of victory
until this second and now, their ranks depleted
by hundreds left on the naked field behind
them, they had still opposed to them a formidable
force of loyal soldiers, whose number they
did not know. Their confidence had flown;
this terrible hill had been a death trap, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
they had been assured of an easy and bloodless
victory. For an instant they hesitated; then
they turned and retreated, a scathing fire
from the coveted trenches impelling them onward
in their flight for safety.</p>

<p>The excitement among the government
troops was intense. The three Americans were
cheered to the echo by the wildly joyful
soldiers.</p>

<p>A group of horsemen galloped up the hill;
they approached the trenches amid welcoming
cries from the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Syd, we can do no more here,&#8221; Phil
cried breathlessly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get away quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>With O&#8217;Neil, they pressed their way through
the jubilant natives, but had gone but a short
distance when they were stopped by a horseman;
he reined in his foaming steed, swung
himself from his saddle and placed himself
smilingly before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our president desires to meet our American
allies,&#8221; he cried proudly.</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s countenance fell. He had been hoping
to avoid this meeting, yet he could not
refuse; to do so would have the appearance of
a slight to the chief magistrate of the country.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>He acknowledged the honor paid them with
appropriate words, and then they followed the
officer back toward the group of horsemen now
halted in the rear of the trenches which the
boys had just left.</p>

<p>&#8220;My good friends,&#8221; a familiar voice hailed
in Spanish, and the next minute the lads were
embraced by their warm friend, Captain Garcia.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Barras,&#8221; the latter cried, dragging
the bashful Americans forward, &#8220;to these
three American officers we owe our success at
Rio Grande.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general&#8217;s face was wreathed in smiles.
He was joyful at snatching victory from what
had seemed to him but a few minutes before
utter defeat. He grasped the hands of
both lads and in his native tongue expressed
his heartfelt obligations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;ors,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have accomplished
that which I was powerless to do. These
machine guns I knew were leaving your
country for my enemy, but I was powerless to
find out the means by which they were to be
landed; your marvelous work here to-day has
saved my government from being overthrown
and the lawless rebels raised to power. Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
defense of this hill with but a company of raw
soldiers has won our highest praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia&#8217;s face wore a puzzled look.
He knew nothing of the defense of La Mesa.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Barras,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;these
gentlemen have shown themselves our staunch
friends; they have risked their lives many
times for our cause. I have told you but an
unimportant part of their work for me on board
the &#8216;Aquadores,&#8217; and now they have saved the
day for us here. Cannot we suitably reward
them for their heroic services?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Barras,&#8221; Phil finally managed to
explain to the president of the republic, who
had been directing the defense in person, &#8220;for
my companions and myself, I thank you for
the high compliments you and Captain Garcia
are paying us, but we dare not allow the
knowledge of our work to become common
property. I crave your pardon if we appear
ungrateful, but we ask that our services here
and at Rio Grande be kept as secret as is possible.&#8221;
He stopped, seeing the disappointment
and surprise on the president&#8217;s face; then he
continued hurriedly: &#8220;These machine guns
arrived in La Boca in such a manner that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
felt ourselves in honor bound to see that they
did no harm to your government; the small
service we have been able to do for you has
been made possible through our determination
to prevent the guns from falling into
the hands of your enemy. We have acted
upon the dictates of our consciences, but we
are in the naval service of the United States
and our motives, if the circumstances were
known, might be easily misconstrued to our
ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The president, though disappointed at not
being allowed to show his official appreciation
for their invaluable services, readily promised
secrecy, and after bidding them farewell they
were allowed to continue on their way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are the two finest dagos I have ever
seen,&#8221; exclaimed O&#8217;Neil, after they had gotten
out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>The excitement of the last half hour had
been so intense that the lads had quite forgotten
to ask of O&#8217;Neil his experiences in the
house of Juarez.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get into the house?&#8221; Phil
questioned the sailor, while they walked rapidly
toward the city.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>The boatswain&#8217;s mate told his experiences,
quite ashamed of his conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly acted like a landlubber,&#8221; he
complained mournfully. &#8220;I walked right
into the spider&#8217;s web with both eyes wide open,
but seeing nothing. Think of my deserting
you and letting you do all this work alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it was O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s turn to ask questions,
and the lads told him of their nerve-racking
ordeal in the tunnel and of their difficulty in
getting the soldiers to help them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on the right track then, after all,&#8221;
cried O&#8217;Neil. &#8220;It was Juarez&#8217;s house, and he
was at home. It wasn&#8217;t a very hospitable reception
he gave me,&#8221; he added, putting his hand
to his swollen head. &#8220;I fired at one of them in
the darkness and that&#8217;s the last I remember
until the little dago doctor tried to make me
swallow some ill-tasting medicine. Then I
broke away from him and ran up the hill just
in time to see Mr. Lazar point his gun at you;
his face was not encouraging, so I thought the
gun was safer in its holster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t have dared shoot you, Phil,&#8221;
Sydney exclaimed, &#8220;would he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might have,&#8221; answered the lad thoughtfully;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
&#8220;he saw that we must defeat his plans
if we remained, and in the excitement after
the assault had commenced, it could not have
been laid at his door.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Americans were now in the city. They
walked rapidly through the crowded streets;
excited groups of natives had gathered and
were discussing in loud tones the battle which
they had just witnessed from afar. They had
seen the assault and had expected to see their
homes given over to pillage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; asked Sydney, as
they pressed their way through the joyful natives.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the legation,&#8221; Phil explained. &#8220;I am
going to put the minister on his guard against
the villain who gave him the information
which nearly lost the day for the government.
Once the president of the republic, General
Barras, hears of his treachery, his firm will
cease to do business in La Boca.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The firm can be no other than La Fitte
and Company,&#8221; declared Sydney, &#8220;the one
that is striving to get the concessions away
from the American syndicate; but this man
surely cannot hope to succeed now; the rebels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
have lost. With the Colt guns, properly handled,
in addition to artillery and infantry, the
city will now be impregnable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; agreed Phil, &#8220;but it is better
to render this man harmless; he doubtless
stands high in the confidence of General
Barras. You heard the minister say that he
did not wish his name connected with the information;
that was of course an act of caution
in case the rebels failed; but now I feel
sure the minister will divulge his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reaching the legation they met Marshall,
in charge in Lazar&#8217;s absence; his men ready
under arms in case of need.</p>

<p>He greeted them in astonishment. The
midshipmen for the first time appreciated
what a sorry sight they presented; their white
uniforms stained with mud and sprinkled
with blood; while O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s burly figure was
incased in a suit of khaki many sizes too
small.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who won?&#8221; Marshall questioned anxiously.
&#8220;We have been hearing the firing
for the last two hours. The bullets have
been whistling over us by the hundreds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all over,&#8221; Phil answered. &#8220;General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
Ruiz was repulsed and General Barras holds
his lines strongly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marshall and his men were not at all
pleased to hear the news. They had anticipated
interesting work if the city were
taken by the rebels and their longing for
adventure had received a keen disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this work for nothing,&#8221; Marshal cried
dejectedly. &#8220;We have been kept here ready
for over two weeks, expecting any moment
to have exciting times, and now there isn&#8217;t
going to be anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the minister?&#8221; questioned Phil
intent on his mission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inside, in his office,&#8221; answered Marshall,
leading the way into the legation.</p>

<p>The diplomat received them immediately,
his manner anxious and excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can see nothing from this house,&#8221; he
exclaimed, as the midshipmen entered the
office, &#8220;and I have as yet heard no news
of the battle. Mr. Lazar went out to the
lines to observe, but as yet has not returned,
and the firing has been stopped now for over
a half hour.&#8221; Then his restless eyes were attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
to the disheveled uniform of the
lads before him. &#8220;You have been in the
battle?&#8221; he questioned eagerly. &#8220;Tell me
quickly, must I send to the admiral to land his
men? Are the rebels advancing into the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We witnessed the fight,&#8221; Phil answered
promptly; &#8220;your fears are groundless, sir.
General Barras has repulsed the enemy at
every point;&#8221; he stopped and looked at the
minister, a mischievous smile on his face;
&#8220;the main attack was on La Mesa.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minister gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;And on Tortuga Hill, what of that?&#8221; he
exclaimed in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;The attack there was a well devised feint
that came near defeating the government,&#8221;
Phil explained, and then he tersely described
the battle, but said nothing of the part they
had taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I might have brought defeat on
the government arms in giving the information
I had received from Se&ntilde;or Mareno,&#8221;
he cried aghast. &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means,&#8221; returned Phil dramatically,
&#8220;that Mr. Mareno is in league with the
rebels.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; exclaimed the minister
quickly. &#8220;His firm has too much at stake
to cast their fortunes with such scoundrels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was surprised that the minister could
not see the villainy of Mareno; it was plain
enough to him. Then he realized the minister
did not possess the mass of incriminating
evidence that they held against him.
How could he show the true character of
this man without betraying himself and his
companions?</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the valuable concessions
held by the American syndicate?&#8221; he asked,
seeing a way to enlighten the minister. &#8220;Who
has the power to give and take away this
concession right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The president of Verazala only,&#8221; replied
he perplexedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; continued Phil; &#8220;if Ruiz
was president to whom would he give the
concession?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To those who offer him the largest price,&#8221;
the minister answered readily, &#8220;and that has
always been this American syndicate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but suppose he should be heavily
in debt financially to the firm of Se&ntilde;or Mareno,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
besides being bound down by promises before
he became president. What then?&#8221; questioned
Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember now that La Fitte and Company
have bid for the concession,&#8221; said the
minister thoughtfully, &#8220;but their price was
too small. It&#8217;s but a matter of money, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Mareno of that firm?&#8221; asked Phil,
though he knew he must be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the minister, &#8220;he is the head
and the largest stockholder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that proves my case,&#8221; cried the lad.
&#8220;La Fitte and Company desire the Pitch-Lake
concession and also the new concession which
American capital is endeavoring to obtain,
to open up the rich mining country in the
interior of the republic, which will include
the right to build a railroad over the mountains
and thereby open to the sea the large
rubber, coffee and sugar industries now shut
in by this impassable mountain range.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remarkable,&#8221; exclaimed the minister,
intensely excited. &#8220;Why should I not have
thought of that? I believed it was but a
meaningless revolution to change the party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
in power. I had no thought that such black
intrigue might be bound up in it. What
villains these men are to sacrifice hundreds
of lives for the sake of their own pockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was by the merest accident that we
unearthed the plot,&#8221; said Phil delighted at the
success of his argument. &#8220;There are many
of Ruiz&#8217;s sympathizers within the city who
would have welcomed him with delight if
he had been even partially successful to-day.
Many of General Barras&#8217; regiments were ready
with but slight encouragement to join the
rebels; all of this was done with Se&ntilde;or
Mareno&#8217;s gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What treachery!&#8221; the minister cried
angrily. &#8220;I shall write immediately to the
president and give him the name of my informant.&#8221;
Then he looked with admiration at
the midshipmen. &#8220;You boys are a marvel
to me; how did you ever find this out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well pleased with the impression their disclosure
had made on the minister, they withdrew
from his presence without telling him
further. They were glad he hadn&#8217;t required
proofs; to have given them would have
greatly embarrassed the lads, for they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
not tell the minister of the part they had
taken in recapturing the arms; he might not
agree to secrecy and this knowledge in the
hands of the State Department in Washington
might cause serious consequences.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil joined them at the door of the
legation; he was now in a sailor uniform,
borrowed from one of the men of the
guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lazar is here,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;with
a Spaniard; they just came through the
gate. There they are,&#8221; he added as the two
men approached the house by the gravel
walk and mounted the steps of the legation.</p>

<p>As Lazar passed them the lads saluted
stiffly. He turned a glance full of hatred on
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, wait here; I wish to see you,&#8221;
he ordered sharply, then he and the visitor
entered the minister&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>Phil stepped inside the house noiselessly
and stopped breathlessly to listen. A sound
of voices raised excitedly came from within the
room. Phil quickly rejoined his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Mareno,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;the
owner of the automobile. I can never forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
his voice in the tunnel. He will try to undo
our work with the minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inside of a minute Se&ntilde;or Mareno appeared;
his swarthy face was pale, showing
the mental strain he was enduring.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I too was deceived,&#8221; he was
urging the minister, standing on the threshold
of his office.</p>

<p>The latter&#8217;s answer was diplomatic:</p>

<p>&#8220;You can readily explain that to General
Barras,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;My letter will show
him that I did not misinform him intentionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Mareno thought deeply and was
about to speak, but as he glanced up at the
office door the minister had gone within.
Then he turned and regarded the midshipmen
blankly; a spark of recognition turned
his face unconsciously a shade paler, then
he strode away down the steps without a
word.</p>

<p>A moment afterward Lazar confronted
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; he said coldly, &#8220;you have
put your authority above mine. I order you
and your companions to return to the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
immediately. Your mutinous conduct on La
Mesa shall not pass unnoticed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s blood boiled with anger. His hands
twitched and he controlled himself with
difficulty. He glanced at his companions,
who regarded him inquiringly; he saw he
must obey.</p>

<p>As they left the legation, they pondered
deeply over their predicament. Lazar would
report the occurrence on La Mesa. The
admiral and Captain Taylor might in their
hearts be glad the lads had acted as they had,
but their high positions in the navy forbade
their official countenance.</p>

<p>Lazar might not see fit to report aught but
Phil&#8217;s disobedience; in time of urgent danger
on foreign soil, he, as their senior officer
ashore, had ordered them to leave La Mesa
and Phil had deliberately refused for himself
and companions.</p>

<p>The penalty in the &#8220;articles of war&#8221; under
which naval courts adjudged their punishments
was dismissal from the service.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>AN IMPORTANT WITNESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">How</span> has he the face to report you for disobeying
his order when he must realize that
we have evidence enough against him to dismiss
him from the service?&#8221; exclaimed
Sydney as they were on their return.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what puzzles me, too,&#8221; declared
Phil. &#8220;What can he gain by having me court-martialed?
He can hardly expect me not to
use all the weapons I have to fight him;
though when you sum it up our proofs are
not very strong: Juarez is dead, and Mareno,
even if he knows the part Lazar played in the
arms case, would not testify before a naval
court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Craig&#8217;s evidence,&#8221; Sydney interrupted
earnestly, &#8220;will prove that he deliberately
betrayed his trust and gave up the arms. If
this evidence can be placed before the court,
Lazar&#8217;s reasons for ordering us from La Mesa
will be clearly shown.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>&#8220;Lazar can&#8217;t know that Craig has confessed
to us,&#8221; Phil replied happily, &#8220;and he believes
he&#8217;ll have everything his own way. If he
knew that Craig had confided to us his secret
of the stolen arms, he would not have reported
me for the incident on La Mesa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What hold has he over this man Craig?&#8221;
Sydney questioned thoughtfully. &#8220;Would this
influence be sufficient to seal his lips? Suppose
he should deny telling us that the arms
were stolen from the cellar of the legation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if he should,&#8221; Phil answered
decidedly, &#8220;your testimony that you heard
him give the information would be taken by
the court. He must tell the truth in the
witness box; if not it will not be difficult to
impugn his statements. However, you must
see him as soon as possible and tell him if he
will speak the truth we shall see that no harm
comes to him. He fears Lazar, but if you can
show him that we are powerful enough to
protect him, unless I am much mistaken in
the man, he will be glad to tell the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; cried Sydney joyfully, &#8220;that
Lazar has caught a tartar this time. What
fun it will be to see his face when he hears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
that Craig has told of his dishonest dealings
with Juarez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reaching the landing they took the first
boat back to the &#8220;Connecticut&#8221; and reported
their return to the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain wishes to see you at once,&#8221;
that officer said, addressing Phil.</p>

<p>Phil went immediately down the cabin
ladder and was ushered by the orderly into
the presence of Captain Taylor.</p>

<p>A glance at his chief&#8217;s face told the anxious
lad that Lazar had already made his report.</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield, who had been in conversation
with the captain as the boy entered the
cabin, excused himself quickly and left, casting
a glance of sympathy at Phil as he passed
him.</p>

<p>It seemed to the waiting youth that he
must have been standing there a long time
before Captain Taylor&#8217;s voice relieved the oppressive
silence; its tone was not unkind, but
it was strictly official.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have but this minute received Mr.
Lazar&#8217;s report of the battle,&#8221; he spoke slowly,
punctuating his words; &#8220;he tells of the rout
of the rebels, which is good news indeed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
he makes a serious charge against you, Mr.
Perry.&#8221; Here the captain took in his hand a
paper which he had doubtless been reading to
the executive officer before Phil had appeared.
&#8220;This is Mr. Lazar&#8217;s report; I shall read it to
you: &#8216;It is my painful duty to report to you
the following incidents which happened about
4 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> this afternoon,&#8217;&#8221; the captain read from
the paper in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;By order of the minister I left the legation
at 3:30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> and rode out to the lines to
view the battle which I believed was about to
commence. Upon my arrival at the outskirts
of the city the first assault was made,
which I was too far away to witness distinctly,
but I saw that the rebels were repulsed.
From my position I sighted two figures in
white on the top of the hill, La Mesa; these
aroused my suspicions, believing they were
foreigners helping the government arms.
Upon closer investigation I was astounded to
recognize in these figures Midshipmen Perry
and Monroe, apparently in command of a
detachment of Verazala infantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Believing that they were committing an
unwise act, I approached Mr. Perry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
ordered him to leave the hill at once and return
with me to the legation.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He refused to obey and defied my authority,
turning his back upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;By your order I was in supreme command
over our men ashore and feel that I
was within my authority in giving this order
to Midshipman Perry.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Such a serious breach of military discipline
should not go unpunished, and for the
good of the service I have to request that
Midshipman Philip Perry be brought to trial
by general court martial on charges growing
out of this incident.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain ceased reading and laid the
paper on the table.</p>

<p>Phil was alarmed at the serious sound of
the charge against him; he felt he was hopelessly
involved. Even if he could prove Lazar
a traitor would not his own guilt be proven?
According to military law an order must be
obeyed without question. He tried to speak,
but his throat was dry. Captain Taylor
waited, his face full of compassion for the
stunned boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not ask a statement from you now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
Mr. Perry,&#8221; the captain said finally. &#8220;I fear
the charge is of such a serious character that
the admiral will order a court at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil left the cabin and with a heart full of
bitterness sought his own room. Sydney
read in his chum&#8217;s face the bad news.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he has already done his work,&#8221; he exclaimed,
as Phil entered looking tired and
worried; &#8220;but cheer up; you are in the right,
and when the court has the true story, Lazar
will find himself in a position that with all his
cleverness he will have difficulty to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil smiled gratefully at his companion&#8217;s
cheerful attempt to console him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, you must defend me,&#8221; he said, throwing
himself in his chair dejectedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
very serious charge,&#8221; and then Phil quoted
the letter of Lazar&#8217;s, almost word for word,
so deeply had it made its impression on his
mind.</p>

<p>Sydney agreed readily to act as Phil&#8217;s
counsel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our case,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;must be based
on Lazar&#8217;s motives for ordering us from the
hill. This we can prove through Craig.
Never fear, Phil, you will be cleared.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>&#8220;My last hope is in Craig,&#8221; answered Phil;
&#8220;if he goes back on us, we are powerless.
We can do nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame that such a scoundrel as Lazar
can pose as such a paragon of virtue,&#8221; cried
Sydney hotly, &#8220;while we know what a double
dyed villain he is and have no means of
proving it. As you say, we are alone dependent
upon breaking down the testimony of his
accomplice. If Lazar doesn&#8217;t know of Craig&#8217;s
confession this may be easy, but if he does he
will take great pains to teach Craig how to
answer our questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s already dejected expression turned to
one of deeper disappointment as he pondered
on the last words of his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What innocents we are!&#8221; he cried suddenly.
&#8220;Lazar surely must know that we
have discovered his intrigue, else how could
we have found the hiding-place of the arms?
If, as I suspect, Juarez sent him word we
were in the house on La Mesa, then Lazar
would reason that he had been found out and
would know that our information must have
come from Craig. And yet, knowing this, he
reports me,&#8221; he added thoughtfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>&#8220;Syd,&#8221; he continued after a pause, &#8220;this
man is no common villain. We have to deal
with a very clever rogue. There is something
more that we don&#8217;t know about; he is
not going into this court martial blindly. If
he can have me found guilty then he will be
safe, because our testimony against him will
be declared prejudiced and would not be admitted
before a court.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two midshipmen were in a state of
great excitement over their perplexing position,
but their labors on this eventful day had
so wearied them, that it was but a short time
after they had &#8220;turned in&#8221; before they fell
into a sound and peaceful sleep.</p>

<p>They awoke the following morning feeling
greatly refreshed and better able to grapple
with the problem.</p>

<p>All danger that the rebels would force an
entrance into the city being over, the admiral
ordered the legation guard back to the &#8220;Connecticut.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney were on deck when Lazar
and his men returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t there!&#8221; Phil gasped as he saw
the last man come up the gangway ladder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
and &#8220;fall in&#8221; in ranks on the quarter-deck.
&#8220;I watched every man and Craig isn&#8217;t among
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps there are others ashore, yet to
come,&#8221; vouchsafed Sydney hopefully.</p>

<p>Lazar had reported to the officer of the
deck and had then gone down the companionway
to announce his return to the captain.</p>

<p>Marshall and Morrison remained on deck
with the men awaiting Lazar&#8217;s return, before
being dismissed to go to their quarters.</p>

<p>Phil and Sydney examined closely every
one of the hundred bronzed faces of the legation
guard. Craig was missing.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Lazar returned, and gave
orders to &#8220;break ranks&#8221; and go forward;
then he turned to his two assistants, and
raising his voice for the benefit of Phil and
Sydney, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Craig is a good riddance. I believed he
was a trustworthy man, but I find he has
betrayed my confidence. I have recommended
to the captain that no effort be
made to apprehend him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lazar cast a glance of mingled triumph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
and scorn at the discomfited midshipmen as
he passed down the hatch to the deck below.</p>

<p>The boys were stupefied. This contingency
had never occurred to them. So Craig had
deserted!</p>

<p>&#8220;We can catch him, Phil,&#8221; Sydney cried,
when the terrible significance of Lazar&#8217;s words
forced themselves upon him; &#8220;steamers are
infrequent, and if he remains in the country
he can be apprehended by the government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lazar has doubtless arranged for that,&#8221;
Phil answered brokenly; &#8220;he is too clever for
us, Syd. We are children in his hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must capture him,&#8221; Sydney exclaimed,
thoroughly aroused; &#8220;he is our only
witness.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil, showing no ill effects from his
rough handling of the day before, was back
at his ship&#8217;s work. He saw the boys standing
disconsolately on the quarter-deck and
crossed over to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, O&#8217;Neil?&#8221; Phil inquired
solicitously as the sailor saluted them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never better, sir,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but you,
sir, I&#8217;m sorry to hear of the trouble you are
in; and that fellow Craig, that you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
counting so much on, has deserted. The
men say he is too sick to go far and had
been acting queer like all last evening.
When the guard fell in to be marched on
board this morning he was missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too sick to go far?&#8221; questioned Phil
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; the sailor answered, &#8220;the men
of the guard say he coughed all the time;
they all believe he can&#8217;t live long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil turned to Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd, Lazar will try to send him off by
steamer. If he hasn&#8217;t gone already we may
be able to catch him,&#8221; he cried hopefully.
&#8220;Lazar has furnished him money and has
recommended to the captain that no search
be made for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t been no steamer sailing since
last night,&#8221; declared O&#8217;Neil; &#8220;that steamer
with the blue smoke-stack is the next one
to leave; she&#8217;s flying the sailing flag now.
Craig must be still in La Boca.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd,&#8221; Phil cried hurriedly, &#8220;I may be
put under arrest now at any moment, but
you and O&#8217;Neil will be free. It may be possible
that we can outwit Lazar yet. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
must go ashore and find Craig. Promise him
anything if he will return and speak the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he is in La Boca, trust O&#8217;Neil to find
him,&#8221; declared the sailor stoutly.</p>

<p>Phil saw the captain&#8217;s orderly approaching.
His heart felt like lead: here was his summons,
he felt sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Taylor would like to see Mr.
Perry,&#8221; the orderly announced as he reached
Phil&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>The lad descended to the cabin with sinking
hopes. He found the captain awaiting
him, nervously pacing up and down his narrow
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; he said as he caught sight of
the attentive midshipman, &#8220;I have a very
painful duty to perform;&#8221; he held a paper in
his outstretched hand; Phil took it in silence.
&#8220;Those are the charges against you,&#8221; he continued
slowly; &#8220;the admiral orders that you
be tried by court martial.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad&#8217;s eyes were full of tears of anger
and mortification. He dared not speak. He
feared he might say too much and prejudice
himself with his captain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>&#8220;You will send me your sword and consider
yourself in close arrest.&#8221; The captain
added, &#8220;The trial is set for to-morrow morning
at eight o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the captain dropped from his voice its
official coldness and put his hand affectionately
on the humiliated lad&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, you have been a great disappointment
to me,&#8221; he said sadly. &#8220;Your
work here has been all the more admirable because
it can never receive official sanction.
It must always be kept a secret from our
government in Washington. Even our admiral,
as powerful as he is, could not save
you if your part in this war came to the
official ears of the Navy Department. &#8216;The
end justifies the means&#8217; does not fit such a
case. By your loyal and plucky work, you
and your companions have saved our government
from very complicating and perhaps
dangerous diplomatic conflicts with foreign
powers. You have also saved American
merchants from great financial losses. But
nevertheless,&#8221; he added after a short pause,
&#8220;Mr. Lazar was well within his authority
when he ordered you away from La Mesa;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
and from my knowledge of that officer I believe
he was acting according to his best judgment
and for your own good. You should
not have taken part in this fight at all, but it
was far worse as you did it, openly, wearing
the uniform of the United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, Captain Taylor,&#8221; cried Phil
earnestly, &#8220;we were not on La Mesa for pure
love of fighting; there was a good reason
and I hope to be able to show soon that my
act of disobedience was not as black as it
looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope, Mr. Perry,&#8221; Captain
Taylor replied kindly, &#8220;that you can explain
this seemingly deliberate act of insubordination.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil left the cabin in a happier frame of
mind than he had entered. He was assured
of Captain Taylor&#8217;s sympathy and his and his
companion&#8217;s work had been appreciated. He
saw how these high officers must regard their
work on La Mesa, knowing nothing of the
story of the Colt guns and Lazar&#8217;s part in
their betrayal. If Craig could be found now
all would be plain sailing. The court on
hearing his testimony against Lazar would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
surely acquit Phil of criminality in his disobedience.</p>

<p>He entered his room glad in the thought
that with two such friends as Sydney and
O&#8217;Neil, Craig would soon be found and
brought aboard to give his evidence before the
court.</p>

<p>But Sydney&#8217;s greeting sent the happiness
out of his heart and put there a feeling of
hopelessness beyond power of expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phil, that scoundrel has laid his wires
cleverly,&#8221; he cried angrily. &#8220;O&#8217;Neil and I are,
by the admiral&#8217;s order, restricted to the ship
until the &#8216;Connecticut&#8217; sails. Lazar is bound
that Craig shall not be found.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>THE COURT MARTIAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> felt his last hope had gone. Craig,
their only witness, would make good his
escape. There was nothing left for him but
to face the court martial and be found guilty
of one of the most serious offenses against
military discipline.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly hopeless, Syd,&#8221; he exclaimed
dejectedly; &#8220;we can make no defense without
this man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot Marshall be induced to hunt for
him ashore?&#8221; questioned Sydney thoughtfully;
&#8220;he is your friend and hasn&#8217;t any love
for Lazar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might do that,&#8221; answered Phil readily.
Then he shook his head on second thoughts;
&#8220;it won&#8217;t help us. Lazar will find it out and
see a means of keeping him aboardship too.
He is a master schemer.&#8221;</p>

<p>A soft tap on their door sounded startlingly
to the unstrung lads. They exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
glances, despair written on their faces. They
had spoken in low tones, but they knew the
ship was a sounding-board. Had they said
anything that might be advantageous to their
enemy?</p>

<p>Phil stepped to the curtain and drew it
cautiously aside, half expecting to see the
cynical face of Lazar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, O&#8217;Neil!&#8221; he cried gladly, &#8220;you
gave us a scare. Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Phil added, seeing the look
of determination in the sailor&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that &#8216;all hands&#8217; are to be kept
on board ship,&#8221; the sailor answered. &#8220;I heard
Mr. Penfield talking to Mr. Lazar on the
quarter-deck a minute ago. The admiral
has given the order. Mr. Lazar has gone to
the admiral himself to get permission to go
ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his doing,&#8221; cried Sydney hotly.
&#8220;But he&#8217;ll get the permission,&#8221; he added
dejectedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I was going to say, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil continued,
&#8220;is, I have made my mind up to
catch this fellow Craig, and I&#8217;ve come for
that uniform I wore on the dago war-ship.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>&#8220;I knew you couldn&#8217;t be downed, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221;
Sydney exclaimed delightedly. &#8220;I have the
three suits here. I was keeping them for
souvenirs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s face during the time his companions
were talking wore a look of quiet dignity.
He now put his hand affectionately on the
sailor&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t allow you to take this risk,&#8221; he
said gently. &#8220;It&#8217;s my misfortune and I shall
stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil interrupted him hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, John O&#8217;Neil is always ready
to obey you, but in this, sir, I know what is
best. I want the clothes. I am too old a
hand, sir, to get caught. You can trust me for
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil would have broken in, but O&#8217;Neil
would be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew how you&#8217;d act about it, sir, but I
need the uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney dragged the uniform out from a
locker and gave it to the sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;don&#8217;t listen to
Mr. Perry. He seems to want to be convicted.
I&#8217;ll go with you if you need me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied decidedly. &#8220;You
are better here cheering up Mr. Perry, but
before that court meets you&#8217;ll see me bringing
Craig back, ready to give his evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your plan?&#8221; Sydney asked, following
the sailor from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this, sir,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I am going
to watch every vessel that leaves port, and if I
find Craig, I&#8217;ll get him to come back with
me, whether he wants to or not. Trust me,
sir, if I clap eyes on him back he&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; Sydney agreed; &#8220;our
last hope is in you, O&#8217;Neil,&#8221; he added, as he
returned to join Phil.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil seems confident that he can locate
him, Phil,&#8221; Sydney said in a cheering voice
as he re&euml;ntered their stateroom. &#8220;He only
told me half of his plan,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;I believe he knows what he is doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil was reading over the fatal paper given
him by the captain. The wording of the
charges against him seemed written in fire on
his brain.</p>

<p>A moment later the captain&#8217;s orderly came
for the midshipman&#8217;s sword. Phil gave it to
him with a heart full of anguish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;Lieutenant Barnes is on deck, sir, and
would like to see Mr. Perry,&#8221; the orderly said,
a look of sympathy in his face. &#8220;I hope you
ain&#8217;t guilty, sir,&#8221; he added hastily.</p>

<p>Phil almost smiled at the earnestness of the
kind-hearted marine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, orderly,&#8221; he answered gratefully.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Barnes entered the boys&#8217; stateroom
shortly afterward. The lads stood
quickly to attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry, I am the judge advocate of
your court,&#8221; the officer announced in official
tones, holding himself very straight and regarding
Phil coldly. &#8220;I see you have received
a copy of the charges against you,&#8221;
noticing the paper Phil held in his nervous
hand. &#8220;Do you desire any one to act as your
counsel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s throat was parched; he swallowed
several times before he could find voice to
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Midshipman Monroe, sir, has offered,&#8221; he
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; the officer consented; &#8220;you
will be ready at 8 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> to-morrow. Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
counsel will inform me at that time the
witnesses you wish to call in your defense.&#8221;
He bowed ceremoniously and withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much kindness in him, is
there, Syd?&#8221; Phil observed sadly. &#8220;He
believes I am guilty, by the way he looked
at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we to do?&#8221; Sydney exclaimed.
&#8220;If O&#8217;Neil fails you must take the stand and
tell all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I shan&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Phil declared;
&#8220;the court would not believe our estimate
of Lazar. It would be easy for him to convince
the court that he had acted honestly
and that our charges were malicious. If
Craig is not found I must take my punishment
in silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if O&#8217;Neil and I both testify to the
truth of your story, Phil,&#8221; Sydney urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even then,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Lazar could
not be accused. The fact that Craig deserted
would point to the latter&#8217;s guilt in
allowing the guns to be taken from the legation
and would prove Lazar&#8217;s innocence.
Sydney, if Craig is not found I stand convicted.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>The weary, anxious day dragged slowly by.
The fateful morning dawned.</p>

<p>At the hour set, Phil and Sydney were
ready to appear before the court.</p>

<p>Phil dreaded the ordeal. Far rather
would he have faced a battery of Colt guns
than go before those seven commissioned officers,
accused as he was of a military crime.</p>

<p>With heart beating fast, and with pale, set
face he took the chair next the judge advocate;
Sydney sat beside him, a determined
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>Phil raised his head and braved the eyes of
the court.</p>

<p>The picture now before his eyes would never
be forgotten. The officers were all strangers
to him, selected from other ships than his
own. At the head of the long table sat the
president, a captain in the navy, commanding
a battle-ship in the fleet; the other six
officers were all above the rank of ensign.</p>

<p>Phil saw his sword brought in by the
captain&#8217;s orderly and placed on the court
table, its sheathed point directed at himself,
the accused. He knew that this sword
would be the silent tale bearer of the court&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
verdict. If after the trial was over the sword
remained with its point toward him he had
been adjudged guilty, but if upon entering
to receive the judgment, the sword had
been swung with its hilt toward him, then
the court had found him not guilty.</p>

<p>The judge advocate arose, and in a clear
voice read the admiral&#8217;s order assembling
the court for the trial of Midshipman Perry.</p>

<p>The formalities of organization were soon
over and the court was ready to try the accused
on the charges.</p>

<p>As one in a dream Phil heard the detailed
charges read. He knew them by heart, but
now in the cold hard tones of Lieutenant
Barnes they rang ominously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He, the said Midshipman Philip Perry,
did maliciously and wilfully disobey the
order of his superior officer Ensign Jules
Lazar, who was then and there in the execution
of his lawful duty, and further did treat
his superior officer, the said Ensign Jules
Lazar, with contempt, and was insubordinate
to him by words and gestures; this to the
prejudice of good order and military discipline.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>The awful sound took his breath away.
A voice was saying to him in his inner consciousness,
&#8220;You are guilty, you are guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, every word was only too true; he
could deny nothing, but he must plead
&#8220;not guilty,&#8221; in hopes that Craig would
arrive in time to give his testimony.</p>

<p>There was a pause; the judge advocate
cleared his throat. The court shifted their
positions expectantly. Phil&#8217;s heart seemed
almost ready to stop beating while the prosecutor&#8217;s
voice sounded through the quiet
room:</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Philip Perry, have heard the
charges preferred against you. What say
you: Guilty or not guilty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil mustered all his strength and in a clear
voice answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments Lazar entered the courtroom.
He was calm and self-possessed. He
walked up to the president promptly and
took the oath; then he sat down carelessly in
the witness chair, and turned upon Phil a cold
scrutinizing gaze.</p>

<p>Lazar told his story to the hushed court.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
Phil knew it was the truth, but not the whole
truth which Lazar had sworn to tell.</p>

<p>The witness had finished; the judge advocate
turned to Phil, questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish to interrogate the witness?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>Phil shook his head and Lazar withdrew
from the room, casting an incredulous look at
the accused midshipman.</p>

<p>The judge advocate ceased his writing and
looked up at the president of the court.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; he announced slowly,
&#8220;there is no other witness for the prosecution.
Ensign Lazar&#8217;s testimony is not disputed; it
proves every word of the charges against the
accused.&#8221; He sat down in silence, then he
glanced quickly at Sydney, sitting stunned by
Phil&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;The defense begins,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The two lads exchanged glances. O&#8217;Neil
had not returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is your first witness?&#8221; asked the
judge advocate impatiently.</p>

<p>Sydney was about to speak; he would ask
to be put in the witness chair; he could tell
the true story to the court; surely they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
see it was the truth, but Phil&#8217;s quiet resigned
voice cut short his intentions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no witnesses to call,&#8221; he said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>The court was astounded; its members
looked surprisedly at one another. The
president arose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Perry,&#8221; he began, &#8220;do you understand
the gravity of these charges? Can you make
no defense? Can you give no reason, no excuse
for your extraordinary conduct? Will you
not make a statement to the court? Your
record at the Naval Academy and here on the
&#8216;Connecticut&#8217; is too good to be so stained
without some reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>The court showed their accord by nods of
assent.</p>

<p>Phil turned to Sydney, a look of pain in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil has failed,&#8221; Sydney whispered; &#8220;he
would come direct to the court if he were on
board.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil arose to his feet, his face pale and
anxious. The court was silent, in breathless
expectancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can offer no excuse, sir,&#8221; he said in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
voice suppressed with emotion. &#8220;I can only
say that I acted according to my belief in
what was my duty.&#8221; His face became suffused
with embarrassment as he realized how
odd his words must sound to these officers who
knew nothing of the real circumstances; but
he must gain time; perhaps even now O&#8217;Neil
was returning with the missing witness. Once
the trial was finished he would stand convicted
and even Craig&#8217;s testimony could not
change the decision of the court.</p>

<p>&#8220;My first duty was to remain where I was,
and to do this it was necessary that I should
disobey Mr. Lazar&#8217;s direct order. I can say no
more,&#8221; he said finally, covered with confusion.</p>

<p>As Phil stopped and sat down, a hum of astonishment
passed over the court. What did
he mean? Had the strain unbalanced his
mind? were the questions asked in glances
of the eye by his judges sitting solemnly before
him.</p>

<p>The judge advocate arose to his feet to make
his closing address to the court.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he commenced, &#8220;the accused
by the evidence is proved guilty. It is my
duty as prosecutor for the United States Navy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
to point out that the offense of which he is
charged is one of the most serious against
military and naval discipline, and is punishable
under the &#8216;articles of war&#8217; by dismissal
from the navy of the United States. The excuse
offered by the accused is unintelligible
and worthless.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down, his eyes riveted on the president
of the court. The latter raised his hand;
Phil knew that when it fell to the table the
trial would be over and no more witnesses
could be summoned. It was a dreadful moment
for the accused midshipman. He knew
he sat before his judges adjudged guilty of the
military crime of which he was accused.</p>

<p>The president, with his hand still raised,
hesitated; he seemed unwilling to make the
trial a closed book. As he paused thus, there
came a knock on the door of the cabin.</p>

<small>THE SEARCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">O&#8217;Neil</span> after leaving the midshipman went
to his room under the forecastle and hid
away the bundle of clothes until nightfall,
when he intended to leave the ship under the
cover of darkness.</p>

<p>As soon as he was sure his movements
could not be observed, he let himself over the
bow of the battle-ship and silently dropped
into the water; his foreign uniform he carried
in a flat roll on his head. He was a strong
swimmer, and in but a few minutes he was
standing safely on the dock. The friendly
darkness permitted him unobserved to discard
his sailor clothes, and he soon stood
completely disguised in the garb of a Verazala
naval officer.</p>

<p>He started out briskly for the public landing,
hired a shore boat and was soon alongside
the &#8220;Aquadores.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>The officer on duty greeted him as an old
friend, and the boatswain&#8217;s mate was shortly
in Captain Garcia&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil told his errand as soon as Captain
Garcia would allow him time to speak; the
Spaniard was enthusiastic in his reception of
the American sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, sir, I knew you would help me
catch this man,&#8221; he added; &#8220;our young
friend is to be tried by court martial, and
if found guilty will be dismissed from the
service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia showed the anxiety he felt
for Phil&#8217;s predicament.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always at the service of my American
friends,&#8221; he declared immediately; &#8220;but
how may I help you find this man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will go by steamer,&#8221; replied O&#8217;Neil,
&#8220;and we must find out the one and drag him
off before she sails. If I go alone I can&#8217;t do
it, but you are known and they won&#8217;t dare
stop us, if you are with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But may he not have sailed already?&#8221;
questioned Captain Garcia anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of that,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil answered
decidedly; &#8220;he was at the legation late last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
night, and there has been no steamer sailing
since. I&#8217;ll stake anything that he is still
in La Boca.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inside of two hours every vessel in the
harbor had been visited by the two men, but
they were doomed to disappointment. Craig
was not on board any of them.</p>

<p>Bitterly disappointed they walked disconsolately
through the brilliantly lighted streets
of the town; the city was in gala dress,
celebrating the victory won by the government
arms. They passed many soldiers of
both armies, arm in arm; their differences
were forgotten already and they fraternized
as if they had always been the best of
friends.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil felt his mission had failed. To-morrow
morning at eight o&#8217;clock the court
would try the midshipman, and the missing
witness was as far out of his grasp as ever.
Where in this great city could he turn to
search for him? Then his thoughts turned
to Ensign Lazar; he had gone to the admiral
to obtain permission to go ashore when he
went to the midshipmen&#8217;s room. Where
would he be in this thickly populated city?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
O&#8217;Neil felt confident that if he could find
him Craig would not be far away.</p>

<p>The two friends were passing a palatial
residence on the Plaza. An automobile
standing at the curb caught O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s eye,
the chauffeur sitting erect and expectant in
the front seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose house is that?&#8221; he asked, suddenly
turning to Captain Garcia.</p>

<p>&#8220;The house of one of our most loyal
citizens, Se&ntilde;or Mareno,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;he is
rich and powerful and stands high in the
favor of General Barras. That is his
automobile; he rides in it all the time; it
has just been returned to him; it was stolen
on the day of the assault by the rebels from
one of his country villas.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil stopped suddenly and gazed at the
house. Mareno must be there; the automobile
was awaiting him; its gasoline engine
was puffing and ready to propel the heavy
car over the streets of the city at a speed far
greater than they could possibly follow.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia&#8217;s voice interrupted O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s
cheerless thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our president,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
loyal work of Se&ntilde;or Mareno&#8217;s firm, La Fitte
and Company, during the war, has promised
to give the vast mining concession to it. In
these times of rebellion loyalty is a rare
jewel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Mareno do?&#8221; asked O&#8217;Neil in
genuine surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was he that loaned the government the
money to buy the &#8216;Aquadores,&#8217;&#8221; Captain
Garcia answered proudly. &#8220;Our government
had no credit and the company who built the
cruiser would not allow her to leave their
shipyard until every dollar of the money had
been paid. The victory of the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217;
at Rio Grande made the rebel cause a failure,
for if they had won and then had blockaded
La Boca, the government must have fallen.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was puzzled; there was more intrigue
that his friends the midshipmen had
failed to discover. So Mareno had made
himself secure with both sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it had not been for you and your companions,&#8221;
continued Captain Garcia after a
pause, &#8220;we could not have won. My crew, as
you know, were green men and were almost
mutinous. My officers were half-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
and my executive officer I feel sure was in
the pay of the enemy. He resisted my authority
from the day we left the United
States and when we sailed from La Boca for
Rio Grande, I found a means of leaving him
behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Captain Garcia was speaking two
men came hurriedly out of the house and
got into the waiting machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Se&ntilde;or Mareno now,&#8221; exclaimed
Captain Garcia. &#8220;I know him well. He
owns most of the steamship lines, and can
help us by ordering his agents to watch for
this man when he buys his ticket. I shall
speak to him at once,&#8221; and he drew away
from O&#8217;Neil and stepped quickly to the side
of the machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, Se&ntilde;or Mareno,&#8221; he said
saluting him in military fashion. &#8220;May I
detain you but a moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mareno turned a startled face toward the
naval officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he questioned impatiently.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil saw at a glance that the meeting
was inopportune for the merchant. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
sailor edged nearer, his curiosity aroused.
An electric street lamp above them threw
their faces in shadow; but there was something
familiar in the figure sitting beside
Mareno in the automobile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lazar,&#8221; he gasped beneath his breath;
he reached out and took Captain Garcia by
the arm, almost roughly, and wheeled him
about. The next second the automobile had
gone.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia turned on O&#8217;Neil, a world
of surprise in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;He surely could have helped us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor looked about him hurriedly.
So Lazar and Mareno were hiding Craig. If
they would find him they must follow the
automobile; but how?</p>

<p>&#8220;The man with him was Ensign Lazar,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neil explained to the amazed captain. &#8220;If
he recognizes me the game is up. How can
we follow them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was still more amazed at
hearing this startling news. Why was Se&ntilde;or
Mareno with Mr. Lazar? What part had
Se&ntilde;or Mareno in the plot to convict his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
young friend, Midshipman Perry? And was
he a friend of the man who had sold the
machine guns back to the rebels?</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he cried much aroused, &#8220;there&#8217;s
an automobile standing on the next corner,
but I fear we can&#8217;t catch them; Se&ntilde;or
Mareno&#8217;s machine is the fastest in the
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>As luck would have it they found a waiting
machine, and jumping in Captain Garcia
hurriedly gave the order.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariel road, quick,&#8221; he cried to the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>In a minute they were speeding through the
streets and out on the lonely road to Mariel.</p>

<p>The quarry was not in sight; had they
turned off on one of the many cross streets?
This was surely the direction they had taken.</p>

<p>They sped along, O&#8217;Neil pressing money
into the hands of the chauffeur to open wider
his throttle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil whispered triumphantly
as a dark object came in sight
ahead. The pursuers were gaining slowly.</p>

<p>The machine ahead was slowing, and O&#8217;Neil
whispered to their chauffeur to go on by.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
They passed Mareno and Lazar as they
were alighting from the automobile and
entering a large house by the roadside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mareno&#8217;s country home,&#8221; whispered Captain
Garcia as their machine whizzed past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then here we&#8217;ll find Craig,&#8221; replied
O&#8217;Neil confidently, as he directed the chauffeur
to stop their machine.</p>

<p>Out of sight of the overtaken men they
left their machine and went back on foot.
Reaching the house they saw Mareno&#8217;s automobile
had drawn up inside the yard and
the chauffeur had already made himself
comfortable for a nap.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are inside,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil whispered, &#8220;and
will be there some time, from the looks of
that man yonder,&#8221; pointing to the reclining
figure. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man Mareno is powerful,&#8221; he objected.
&#8220;I dare not force an entrance into
his house.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had approached the house from the
rear. O&#8217;Neil pushed a door gently; it yielded
and the next moment they found themselves
in a small room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>The room was unlighted, but the fire on the
hearth illuminated obscurely their surroundings.</p>

<p>A native jumped up from a couch, rubbing
his eyes; seeing the officers he doffed his hat
respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you wish to see, se&ntilde;ors?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are friends of Se&ntilde;or Mareno, who is
up-stairs, is he not? We shall go up,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
answered quickly in a low voice.</p>

<p>The man seemed to hold no suspicions; he
was glad to get back to his interrupted nap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, se&ntilde;ors,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>The two men cautiously walked up the narrow
stairs. Reaching the next floor, they
stopped, breathless, to listen.</p>

<p>A sound of voices came from a room in the
front of the house.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was worried. He did not
relish his mission; there was too much at
stake for him if Mareno discovered that they
had forced an entrance into his house. In
these countries it is but a step to a prison cell
and another to the execution wall where many
men are put to death daily during these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
revolutions. He was anxious to retrace his
steps, but O&#8217;Neil held him firmly by the arm.</p>

<p>The voices of Mareno and Lazar sounded
distinctly; they were talking in loud natural
tones, so sure were they that they were alone
in this lonely house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have changed the letter, Se&ntilde;or Mareno,&#8221;
Lazar was saying; &#8220;here it is: as it reads now
your name does not appear and Midshipman
Perry&#8217;s name has been substituted. But you
must make sure that the minister and the
president never meet, for they might discover
the change in the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have arranged that,&#8221; answered Mareno.
&#8220;As soon as the fleet leaves, which will be to-morrow,
the president will telegraph to Washington
for the minister&#8217;s recall, giving the
reason that he is unsatisfactory to the government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Lazar&#8217;s voice replied; &#8220;then you
have nothing to fear, unless General Ruiz
might tell of your share in the rebellion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Mareno&#8217;s voice had a glad ring, &#8220;he
knows nothing. Juarez alone knew of my support,
and he is dead; he was the agent in all
my transactions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>&#8220;Very well; I shall deliver this letter in
person at the palace this evening,&#8221; Lazar said,
&#8220;and then we must put this man on board the
steamer. I don&#8217;t believe he will live to reach
Mexico.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia knew nothing of the letter,
but from the trend of the conversation between
the two conspirators he saw that the much
trusted Mareno had done something which
Lazar was endeavoring to cover up for him.
He dared not ask O&#8217;Neil; even a whisper
might be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the name of the steamer?&#8221; Lazar
added. &#8220;It is now after midnight. At what
time will she sail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the &#8216;Mercedes&#8217;; one of our own
ships,&#8221; Mareno answered; &#8220;she is scheduled to
sail at daylight and her first port will be Vera
Cruz, Mexico; her captain need know nothing
except that the sick man is to be landed
there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t she sail as soon as we get this man
on board?&#8221; Lazar asked eagerly. &#8220;I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
breathe freer when he is on the high seas. My
enemies have resources and the sooner we get
this man away the less danger there is for me.
The court meets at eight o&#8217;clock, and without
this witness my friend Midshipman Perry
must be convicted.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_350.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><i>THE DOOR OF THE ROOM OPENED<br />
SUDDENLY</i></p>

<p>&#8220;That can be easily arranged,&#8221; Mareno
agreed at once. &#8220;She has already cleared the
custom-house and can sail whenever I give
the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil glanced at Captain Garcia&#8217;s face.
The light through the transom of the room in
which the conspirators were shone dimly on
his strong face. O&#8217;Neil was fairly startled at
its expression. He feared that upon hearing
the course which his enemy would pursue,
Garcia might act precipitately, and spoil the
plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; the sailor whispered, grasping the
captain&#8217;s arm, &#8220;we must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the naval officer could not be moved.
He reached in his pocket and drew out a silver-mounted
revolver, and took a step forward toward
the door of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll spoil everything,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil whispered
hoarsely.</p>

<p>The door of the room opened suddenly and
a flood of light shone out in the hallway.
Lazar stood on the threshold, his face turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
backward over his shoulder; he was talking
to Mareno behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Craig is up-stairs, is he not? I shall get
him and join you immediately,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was terribly anxious. If their presence
were discovered, the conspirators would
change their plans. The light seemed to fall
directly upon himself and Captain Garcia.
How could Lazar fail to see them?</p>

<p>Lazar passed the eavesdroppers so close that
it seemed to O&#8217;Neil detection was a certainty.
What should he do? He dared not lift his
hand against his superior officer. His long
training in the navy had taught him what
terrible consequences would be the result of
such a rash act. He held his breath tightly
and drew Captain Garcia closer against the
wall. The door swung shut and the hall was
again in partial gloom. Lazar&#8217;s footfalls
could be heard ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get out,&#8221; he breathed in relief
as he half dragged his companion down
the steps.</p>

<p>They left the house by the way they had
entered; this time they were not observed, for
the caretaker of the house was fast asleep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>Reaching their automobile they got in and
waited for their enemies to leave the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; Captain Garcia
asked excitedly. &#8220;What is this letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil explained how Mareno had informed
the minister that Ruiz&#8217;s attack would be on
Tortuga Hill. How the midshipmen had
discovered him in the house of Juarez where
the stolen arms were stored, and how the
minister had written a letter to General
Barras telling from whom the information
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;A clever plot indeed,&#8221; cried Captain
Garcia. &#8220;Mr. Lazar has changed this letter
clearing Se&ntilde;or Mareno and putting the guilt
on Midshipman Perry&#8217;s shoulders, and Se&ntilde;or
Mareno has induced the president meanwhile,
before the arrival of the letter, to ask the
Washington government to recall the minister.
My inclinations were as an officer of
our government to arrest Se&ntilde;or Mareno for
treason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would have defeated us,&#8221; answered
O&#8217;Neil. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t have submitted
without a fight and I couldn&#8217;t have raised
my hand against Ensign Lazar.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>&#8220;I can hardly believe that Se&ntilde;or Mareno is
a rebel,&#8221; declared Captain Garcia excitedly;
&#8220;if so, why did he buy the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217; for
General Barras&#8217; government?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy to see now,&#8221; answered O&#8217;Neil
with a superior smile; &#8220;didn&#8217;t you say your
executive officer was mutinous and your crew
were all green men?&#8221;</p>

<p>The naked truth dawned on the unsuspecting
naval officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that Mareno believed that on
our arrival in La Boca the &#8216;Aquadores&#8217;
would fly the rebel flag,&#8221; cried the naval
officer, aghast at the depth of the treason of
which Mareno was the instigator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil replied; &#8220;he thought
it was as good as buying her for the rebels
and a better and easier way. Even when you
went after the rebel ships at Rio Grande, he
was sure you&#8217;d be licked, and before he could
get news of the fight he spread the report
that she&#8217;d been sunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was stunned at the extent
of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I owe you and your companions
much more than I dreamed,&#8221; he cried putting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
his arm affectionately on O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;That explains why their two vessels seemed
so eager to give us battle. They thought we
would prove an easy victim.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now, Captain Garcia,&#8221; he exclaimed
earnestly, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got your chance to repay
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Myself and everything I can command
are at your service,&#8221; the Spaniard gratefully
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then here&#8217;s my plan,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil explained
hurriedly: &#8220;they&#8217;ll put Craig in that machine
and take him to La Boca; then on board the
&#8216;Mercedes,&#8217; and we can&#8217;t stop them. She&#8217;ll
get away and then we&#8217;ll follow her in the
&#8216;Aquadores&#8217; and bring Craig back. Isn&#8217;t that
easy? Will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Willingly,&#8221; the captain exclaimed delightedly.
&#8220;You are a clever man to have thought
of this. Fortunately I have steam up in my
vessel and as soon as we get on board we can
be under way.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed hours to the anxious men before
Mareno&#8217;s machine moved slowly up to the
door; its headlight cutting through the darkness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
illuminating brightly the courtyard in
front of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are going at last,&#8221; whispered O&#8217;Neil.
&#8220;What time is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia took out his watch and
glanced at its face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s after two,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;they have
been in there two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The automobile in front of the house moved
swiftly toward them. As it reached the
machine in which our friends were awaiting it
speeded up and tore past them. O&#8217;Neil looked
closely; the curtains were drawn, and he could
see nothing within.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; questioned Captain
Garcia in amazement. &#8220;They are going
to Mariel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means my plan is no good,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Neil
despairingly. &#8220;Mareno has had the &#8216;Mercedes&#8217;
sent to Mariel and they&#8217;ll put him on
board her there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, man,&#8221; cried Captain Garcia as he
watched Se&ntilde;or Mareno&#8217;s machine fade in the
distance. &#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was in deep thought. Did he dare
attack these men and take Craig forcibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
away from them? It would mean a prison
for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow them,&#8221; he ordered sharply, &#8220;for all
you&#8217;re worth. I&#8217;ll give you ten pesos if you
catch her before we get to Mariel,&#8221; he cried to
the chauffeur.</p>

<p>Their automobile bounded ahead and rushed
along the dark road. Mile after mile was
eaten up by the steel monster. The anxious
men peered ahead hoping to see the dark form
of Mareno&#8217;s machine, but the suburbs of
Mariel were reached and their enemies were
still invisible.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we catch &#8217;em,&#8221; rasped O&#8217;Neil, &#8220;we must
seize Craig by force; it&#8217;s our last chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was delighted. That had
been his plan from the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll swing for it if Mr. Lazar recognizes
me,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil muttered, &#8220;but the fun&#8217;ll be
worth it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The black smudge in the road ahead of them
slowly took shape out of the darkness. The
anxious seekers breathed easier, as they looked
to their weapons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring her alongside,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil ordered the
amazed chauffeur.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>The man did not relish this hazardous
undertaking on a rough and narrow road, but
the sight of the sailor&#8217;s revolver gave him the
courage to steer his machine abreast of the
fleeing automobile ahead of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold there!&#8221; Captain Garcia shouted firing
his revolver to emphasize his order; &#8220;we
want to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other machine immediately slowed and
the two cars were soon motionless side by side
on the road.</p>

<p>It was but the work of a second for our two
friends to leap out of their car and throw back
the curtains of the other car. O&#8217;Neil, with his
automobile goggles concealing the upper part
of his face, advanced, his revolver in front of
him covering the occupants inside. Captain
Garcia covered with his revolver the trembling
chauffeur.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not here,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil gasped; &#8220;they
have tricked us again.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil was in despair. Captain Garcia&#8217;s
watch showed it was nearly three o&#8217;clock.
Their enemies had surely gone to La Boca
hours ago and had used this automobile
to delay them until they could get Craig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
safely on board the ship and away from the
harbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;They knew we had followed &#8217;em,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
exclaimed. &#8220;That native wasn&#8217;t as sleepy as
we thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a second they were inside their machine
and were speeding back along the road.</p>

<p>Reaching the villa of Mareno, they alighted
by mutual consent and boldly entered the
house by the rear door.</p>

<p>The native was dragged from his bed and
under the terrifying influence of a loaded
revolver at his head confessed that Se&ntilde;or
Mareno and two companions had gone on foot
nearly three hours ago, and that they had
been told of the presence in the house of the
two naval officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can catch her yet,&#8221; Captain Garcia
declared stoutly as they sped back to La Boca.</p>

<p>In the course of what seemed ages to O&#8217;Neil,
but was in reality but a half hour, they were
on board the &#8220;Aquadores.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the cruiser steamed out of the harbor,
O&#8217;Neil heard with a sinking heart the bells
strike on the men-of-war at anchor. It was
four o&#8217;clock and the escaping vessel had over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
three hours start. He had lost. The court
would meet in four short hours and Midshipman
Perry would be adjudged guilty.</p>

<p>Swiftly the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; steamed to the
westward. Captain Garcia and O&#8217;Neil on the
forward bridge watched with failing hopes
the gray of dawn spread on the eastern horizon
behind them. The sea in front was unbroken.
Their prize was not in sight.</p>

<p>Swiftly the cruiser plowed her way through
the tranquil sea, but swifter yet the hands of
the clock moved around its fatal dial. The sun
appeared on the horizon out of a molten sea.</p>

<p>As the gloom slowly melted, the eager
sailor, straining his eyes to discover the
vessel he hoped the increasing light would
soon reveal, sighted the black hull of a
steamer but a few miles ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got her!&#8221; he cried joyously, then
he turned with apprehension and saw the
hands of the clock stood at six. &#8220;Stop her
with a shot!&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;We need every
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Garcia gave a hurried order and
a six-inch shell soared in the air, raising a
column of water close to the merchantman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>&#8220;That did the business,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil exclaimed
as the merchantman stopped and ran up
Verazalan colors at her gaff.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the &#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was
hove to near the &#8220;Mercedes&#8221; and Captain
Garcia and O&#8217;Neil were quickly rowed to
the intercepted vessel.</p>

<p>They climbed to the top of the sea ladder,
where the merchant captain met them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a sick man on board,&#8221; Captain
Garcia began in a tone of authority; &#8220;we
want to take him back with us immediately.
Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailing master gave the naval men a
look of inquiry and amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a man who is very ill; he was
brought on board by Se&ntilde;or Mareno just before
we sailed,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;This is irregular,&#8221;
he added, more boldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are on the high seas,&#8221; Captain
Garcia retorted savagely. &#8220;I alone am responsible
for my actions. Take me to this
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The merchantman was not in his employer&#8217;s
secret, but he readily saw that these
officers were defeating his intentions. Fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
of Mareno made him hesitate. But he knew
he was at their mercy; a glance at the formidable
cruiser close by assured him of that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he said gruffly, leading
them to a stateroom on the lower deck.</p>

<p>There O&#8217;Neil saw a sight that wrung his
heart. Craig&#8217;s emaciated form lay on the
bed; his feverish eyes wide with a terrible
fear as he recognized the boatswain&#8217;s mate, in
spite of his foreign uniform.</p>

<p>The petty officer walked over to his bedside
and looked down at him compassionately.
He put his hand almost affectionately on his
hot brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come back with us, Craig,&#8221; he
said determinedly; &#8220;you&#8217;ll not be harmed.
Don&#8217;t kick; we&#8217;ve just time to get back to
clear Mr. Perry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man cringed and turned white
with terror. A fearful shaking took hold of
his thin form.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not,&#8221; he pleaded in a terrified
whisper. &#8220;They&#8217;ll send me to a penitentiary
for my crimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take on so,&#8221; exclaimed O&#8217;Neil in
exasperation, as he saw the precious minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
slipping away. &#8220;A hospital is where they&#8217;ll
send you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He beckoned to Captain Garcia and together
they lifted the almost exhausted man
from his bed; he struggled feebly, but soon
realized he was only wasting his strength.</p>

<p>They carried him down into the boat and
aboard the &#8220;Aquadores,&#8221; which was soon
heading at top speed back for La Boca.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil did his utmost to cheer the dejected
machinist, who lay tossing miserably, brooding
over his imaginary troubles.</p>

<p>&#8220;You just tell the truth, Craig,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil
counseled, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll not be harmed. Mr.
Lazar will not be in it if you tell your tale
to the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil saw with sinking hopes that it was
eight o&#8217;clock; the court had met and the
&#8220;Aquadores&#8221; was nearly half an hour away.
If she were too late in bringing this important
witness, none but the President of the
United States could grant a reprieve to the
condemned midshipman.</p>

<p>&#8220;But do your best, Captain Garcia,&#8221; he
urged. &#8220;If luck is with us we may save
him yet.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> loud knock on the door resounded
through the tense stillness of the courtroom.
The door was thrown open violently and the
stalwart figure of O&#8217;Neil, with Craig trembling
beside him, stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>Sydney sprang to his feet and placed himself
beside the boatswain&#8217;s mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this unwarranted
intrusion?&#8221; cried the president of the court,
turning fiercely on O&#8217;Neil.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man is a witness for the defense,&#8221;
cried Sydney, joyously pointing at Craig.</p>

<p>The court turned in amazement to gaze at
the would-be deserter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I object to further testimony,&#8221; announced
the judge advocate earnestly; &#8220;the case is now
in the hands of the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil&#8217;s heart beat wildly. Would the president
sustain this objection?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>The president rose to his feet; the court
room became so still that the heavy breathing
of O&#8217;Neil and his prisoner, from their recent
exertions to arrive in time, was plainly audible
above all other sounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;The case is still in the hands of the
defense,&#8221; the president announced. &#8220;I shall
administer the oath to the witness.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil withdrew quietly, leaving Craig
within the courtroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you on a hill called La Mesa near
the city of La Boca on the day of the assault
by the insurgents?&#8221; the judge advocate asked
the witness after he had been directed to take
the stand by the president.</p>

<p>Craig looked at Sydney nervously then he
answered in a trembling voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge advocate jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I object to this witness,&#8221; he cried loudly;
&#8220;he can know nothing of the charges.&#8221;</p>

<p>The president glanced at the faces of his
colleagues. They nodded their approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;The objection is sustained,&#8221; he was on the
point of saying when he caught sight of
Sydney&#8217;s anxious face. The latter had sprung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
from his chair and was endeavoring to catch
the president&#8217;s eye before the fatal words were
uttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what have you to say?&#8221; the officer
asked impatiently.</p>

<p>Sydney thought rapidly; as Phil&#8217;s counsel
he could plead and say things he knew his
chum would be too modest to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask the court&#8217;s indulgence,&#8221; Sydney
commenced, seeking for appropriate words to
convey clearly all that was in his mind to the
members of the court. &#8220;The accused has been
charged with disobeying the orders of his
superior officer on La Mesa the day of the assault.
We have two witnesses who will testify
that in a house belonging to the ex-vice-consul,
Mr. Juarez, thirty Colt automatic guns with
ammunition were found; that these guns were
mounted by the accused and his companions
and manned by a company of government
soldiers. The attack was on La Mesa, although
the minister representing the United States
had informed General Barras that a reliable
informant had told him the attack would be
upon Tortuga Hill. We can show that the
presence of the accused and his companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
was indispensable on La Mesa at the time of
Mr. Lazar&#8217;s arrival. If the order had been
obeyed the Colt guns would have fallen into
the hands of the insurgents, which would have
discredited the minister and the United States
in the eyes of the existing government. Our
witness Craig will tell the part Mr. Lazar has
taken in connection with these arms and will
show why the accused deliberately disobeyed a
positive order.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney sat down, his eyes flashing, his
face pale and anxious.</p>

<p>The court was silent for a fraction of a second
and then a hum of surprised interrogation
spread among its members. All knew of the
captured arms and how the rock-filled boxes
were found at the legation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The witness will be allowed to testify,&#8221; the
president spoke decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no further question to ask,&#8221; snapped
the judge advocate, betraying in his voice the
disappointment at losing his point.</p>

<p>The court looked to Sydney; he whispered
reassuringly to the unnerved Craig.</p>

<p>The terrified sailor&#8217;s voice was so low
pitched that the seven judges strained their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
hearing to listen. The silence was profound.</p>

<p>&#8220;At New York, while we were there for repairs,&#8221;
he commenced feebly, &#8220;I received a
telegram that my sister was dying. I went to
Mr. Lazar as the senior officer on board at the
time and asked for leave to go to her bedside.
He refused me permission. I showed him the
telegram and her picture in a locket I always
carried with me; she was my only living relative
and we were everything to each other. I
implored with tears in my eyes. He refused
again and accused me of deceiving him to get
ashore when I was not entitled to liberty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next day I received word she had
died. The executive officer was on board
and allowed me to go to bury her body.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hated this officer, Ensign Lazar, for his
cruelty to me and when I saw an opportunity
to injure him I was happy. I filed half-way
through the hoist wire in his turret. The
accident happened, as I knew it must; but
unfortunately for me while I was filing the
wire rope Mr. Perry came into the turret; he
heard me at work and called. In my haste
to leave before he could detect me, I turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
in the darkness to escape. The locket was in
the pocket of my blouse which I had laid on
the turret floor. I heard it fall on the metal
deck as I grasped my clothes, but there was
no time to regain it. Afterward I risked
detection in getting it from Mr. Perry&#8217;s room,
but I soon found that Ensign Lazar had already
seen it and recognized the locket I had
shown him, and knew at once that I had been
guilty of injuring the turret. He told me if
I didn&#8217;t want to go to jail for a long term of
years I must do as he told me. I feared him.
He first made me try to injure the &#8216;Vidette&#8217;s&#8217;
machinery on the night those arms were
captured. Then I was wounded and before I
had recovered entirely I was taken ashore
with him and forced to sleep in the cellar of
the legation. He told me that on a certain
night I was to open the boxes, all but one,
and that men would come through a tunnel
below the cellar and carry the Colt guns
away, giving me rocks to put in their places.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard one of the natives who received
the arms tell another where they were to be
taken, and when Mr. Perry discovered that
the boxes were full of rocks and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
arms were gone, I told him what I had done
and where they had been taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to desert, but Mr. Lazar
told me I had betrayed him and that if I
didn&#8217;t he would find a way to dispose of me.
He made all the arrangements and hid me in
the house of a friend of his; then last night
they took me on board a steamer, where O&#8217;Neil
found me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge advocate was on his feet before
the witness&#8217;s voice had died into nothingness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I object to this testimony,&#8221; he cried impetuously,
making a last attempt to reinstate
himself and prove his case against the accused.
&#8220;By his own evidence, this man is a
criminal; his testimony is malicious and
should not be received in evidence. He
stands a would-be deserter from the navy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The president of the court hesitated. The
truth in the judge advocate&#8217;s words was impressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Recall Mr. Lazar,&#8221; he ordered, after a moment&#8217;s
thought. &#8220;He should be here to hear
this evidence and clear up this imputation
against his good name in the navy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>The court orderly was sent to summon
Lazar again before the court.</p>

<p>The two midshipmen sat anxiously watching
the door for the appearance of their
enemy. They knew him to be a clever
rogue. This situation had never occurred to
them. Would Lazar deny Craig&#8217;s testimony
and assert that this sick cringing sailor was
alone guilty of the crime? Craig&#8217;s testimony
came as a surprise to the lads; they had not
suspected that he was the owner of the locket.</p>

<p>The time dragged heavily. The president
became impatient. He glanced at the clock;
its hands showed it was now twenty minutes
since the orderly had gone to notify the
ensign to appear. What had detained him?
He must be on board ship. Permission to
leave the ship would not be granted him
while the court was in session.</p>

<p>The orderly opened the door quietly and
saluted the president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ensign Lazar can&#8217;t be found, sir,&#8221; he reported,
&#8220;but the captain is outside, sir, and
wants to appear before the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Taylor, a sheet of paper in his
hand, strode into the courtroom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>&#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; he exclaimed excitedly,
&#8220;Mr. Lazar has left the ship without obtaining
permission. This is the communication
that he has sent me. I shall read it to the
court.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hereby tender my resignation as an
ensign in the United States Navy.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="indentright2">&#8220;Very respectfully,</span><br />

<span class="indentright">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jules Lazar</span>,</span><br />

&#8220;<i>Ensign, U. S. Navy</i>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The midshipmen were joyous. Lazar&#8217;s courage
had failed him. If he had braved it out
and thrown discredit on Craig&#8217;s evidence,
Phil might have after all stood convicted, for
on this testimony their case was constructed.
But Lazar dared not commit perjury before
his brother officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at a loss to explain its meaning,&#8221;
Captain Taylor added, folding the paper.</p>

<p>The court understood, but by law they
could not enlighten the mystified captain,
who withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any further evidence?&#8221; inquired
the president after the court had recovered a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
little from its surprise. Sydney and the judge
advocate said they had nothing more to offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the trial is finished,&#8221; the president
announced.</p>

<p>The judge advocate, and the accused and
his counsel arose to leave the courtroom, but
the president waved them back to their seats,
glancing inquiringly at his colleagues. Each
member nodded his head in the affirmative,
without hesitation. The president took up
Phil&#8217;s sword lying on the court table with
its point toward the accused, and swung its
hilt within reach of the lad&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>This mute confession that he was held
guiltless filled the midshipman&#8217;s heart with
joy. He looked with gratitude on the president,
who had relieved his mind of its heavy
burden. This acknowledgment of their
verdict was irregular and for that reason
Phil felt all the more grateful. The official
news might be days in reaching him and
relieving his mind. The proceedings must
first be written smoothly, signed by all the
members and reviewed by the admiral before
he would hear officially that he had
been cleared of the terrible charges.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>With hearts overflowing with gladness the
two midshipmen helped the almost prostrated
witness to his feet and supported him from
the court room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have nothing to fear,&#8221; Phil whispered
to him encouragingly as the doctor&#8217;s
attendants bore him away to the sick bay.</p>

<p>At the door of their room they found
O&#8217;Neil awaiting them, a broad smile on
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it was going to be all right,&#8221; he
exclaimed as they greeted him enthusiastically,
&#8220;when I saw Mr. Lazar steal away in
a shore boat from the port gangway. He
slipped off when the officer of the deck
wasn&#8217;t looking and left a paper with the
corporal of the guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was his resignation,&#8221; Sydney explained.
&#8220;After he knew Craig was before
the court his courage deserted him; but
however did you find the witness?&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Neil led them into the room, drawing
the curtain, then detailed his experiences of
the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Garcia is the one who got him,&#8221;
he ended unselfishly. &#8220;If it had not been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
for him and the &#8216;Aquadores,&#8217; Craig would
have gotten away sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Garcia has put me as much in
his debt as he claimed he was in ours,&#8221; exclaimed
Phil gladly. &#8220;Where is he? I hope
we&#8217;ll have a chance to thank him before we
sail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you will, sir,&#8221; O&#8217;Neil returned.
&#8220;He said he&#8217;d go direct to General Barras,
so that Mareno could be nabbed, and then
he&#8217;d come aboard here to say good-bye; he
knows we sail at noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney and O&#8217;Neil went about their routine
work on shipboard, but Phil remained in his
room. His empty sword rack, however, gave
him no twinges of regret. For the first time
in two days he felt at peace with the world.
The illness of Craig, the man whose testimony
had stood between him and dismissal, concerned
him. He resolved to stand by him
and see that he received the best of care.</p>

<p>Phil had been alone with his thoughts
for nearly an hour when he heard a bugle
call ring out sharply on the deck above him,
followed by hoarse commands.</p>

<p>Putting his head out of his air port, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
saw the sailors on the battle-ships manning
the rail, their guards and bands falling in on
their quarter-decks. He knew the import of
this formation at once: the president of Verazala
was on his way to visit the admiral.</p>

<p>Sydney came rushing in for his sword,
giving the news which Phil had already
surmised.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Captain Garcia comes with him,&#8221; Phil
pleaded, &#8220;don&#8217;t let him go without seeing
me. Tell him I am still a prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sydney declared he would see to that as he
buckled on his sword and made for his station.</p>

<p>The roaring of many guns in salute from
the men-of-war, told the imprisoned midshipman
that General Barras was on board
the &#8220;Connecticut.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later Phil received a summons
from the admiral, which he obeyed
with alacrity. On entering the cabin the
astonished boy found himself in the presence
of General Barras and Admiral Spotts. The
midshipman drew himself up stiffly to &#8220;attention,&#8221;
not daring to glance at these important
men; his heart beat wildly.</p>

<p>The admiral held Phil&#8217;s sword in his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>&#8220;I take great pleasure in restoring you to
duty,&#8221; he said handing the confused lad the
badge of honor. The admiral turned toward
General Barras, inclining his head in Phil&#8217;s
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Perry,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>The president acknowledged the introduction
with a cordial hand shake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already had the honor of meeting
Midshipman Perry,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;but I
could not then thank him appropriately, for I
knew only a part of his splendid service to
us.&#8221; Then turning an admiring glance at the
embarrassed boy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or Perry,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;your gallant
deeds will ever be remembered by true patriots
of Verazala. Please convey my personal
thanks to your two companions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil found voice to stammer his gratitude
for this unheard of honor; then he withdrew
from the cabin.</p>

<p>As he closed the door behind him, the knob
was wrenched from his hand and he found
himself in Captain Garcia&#8217;s strong embrace;
that officer had been an unobserved witness to
the lad&#8217;s happy discomfiture.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>While the two friends walked arm in arm
to Phil&#8217;s room, where Sydney was awaiting
them, the boy poured out his heartfelt thanks
to the naval man for his zealous work in his
behalf.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am further in your debt than I can ever
repay,&#8221; exclaimed Captain Garcia, refusing to
listen to the earnest words of his young friend.
&#8220;What I did last night was nothing; and moreover,
it has led to the unmasking of a traitor
to my country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Neil has told us,&#8221; replied Phil. &#8220;Did
you capture him?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or Mareno has escaped,&#8221; the naval
officer told the lads; &#8220;he is now on board a
foreign war-ship and as he is a political
refugee, we cannot demand him. General
Barras knows all, and will give the concessions
to the American syndicate. The minister
of course knows nothing of how close he
was to being summarily ordered home. General
Barras was in such a rage when he
learned of the perfidy of Mareno, his trusted
friend, that I believe if he had been arrested,
the president would have ordered his execution.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>&#8220;Have you heard that Ensign Lazar has
resigned?&#8221; questioned Sydney in his turn.</p>

<p>Captain Garcia was soon told the story of
the court martial and of Lazar&#8217;s desertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see that he doesn&#8217;t prosper here,&#8221;
replied the Spaniard determinedly; then with
genuine regrets he bid them farewell and
joined the president, who was about to leave
the ship.</p>

<p>After Captain Garcia had gone our two lads
lapsed into silence. Their thoughts dwelt
upon the stirring events of the last few weeks.
What a relief and happiness it was to feel that
their energy and foresight had been repaid
and a result pleasing to their countrymen had
been achieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;The captain desires to see Midshipmen
Perry and Monroe,&#8221; the captain&#8217;s orderly announced,
his face beaming as he spoke to Phil.
&#8220;I knowed you were not guilty, sir; every
mother&#8217;s son of us forward were hoping you&#8217;d
not be punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phil thanked the marine, tears of gratitude
springing to his eyes, while the two midshipmen
arose to obey their captain&#8217;s summons.</p>

<p>Captain Taylor awaited them in his cabin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>&#8220;I have just finished reading the proceedings
of Mr. Perry&#8217;s court martial,&#8221; he began,
shaking both boys by the hand, &#8220;and I could
but marvel at the wickedness of Ensign
Lazar: I had believed he was an example of
honor and efficiency. The actions of both of
you have been worthy of the best traditions of
American naval officers. You, Mr. Perry,
were willing to stand convicted of this military
crime rather than make charges against
an officer which were conclusive in your own
mind but which might have been considered
recriminating in the mind of the court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was nothing else to do, sir,&#8221; Phil
replied, his face flushed with pride. &#8220;I did
disobey the order and my one defense was
that I did it to save the good name of our
minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, the officer of the deck reports the
signal to get under way is about to be hoisted
by the admiral,&#8221; the orderly informed the
captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, orderly,&#8221; Captain Taylor answered,
and then turning again toward the
midshipmen, who had moved toward the door
to go to their station: &#8220;Gentlemen, you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
ever consider me ready to help you in your
ambitions in the service. If there is aught I
can do for you, let me know; your services
here can only be rewarded in such ways:
official recognition is denied you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! What is it?&#8221; the captain exclaimed,
reading the look in Phil&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;We would like to go to the Orient, sir,&#8221;
Phil answered bashfully; &#8220;we want to see
the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all you wish?&#8221; returned the captain
surprised at the modesty of the lads. &#8220;I
shall see that your wish is gratified. I have
received an intimation that I shall go to that
station when I have received my promotion
to rear-admiral, which will be in a few months
now, and I shall be happy to have such
officers under my command. I am sorry the
naval regulation does not allow me to nominate
midshipmen on my personal staff.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys thanked him enthusiastically.
Phil stood irresolutely regarding the captain:
there was one more request he wished to
make.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, out with it,&#8221; Captain Taylor exclaimed
kindly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>&#8220;Boatswain&#8217;s Mate O&#8217;Neil, sir, may he go
too?&#8221; Phil asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! Well!&#8221; laughed the captain;
&#8220;yes, I shall see that your good man Friday
goes too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within an hour the squadron was under
way, and the boys took their last view of
La Boca, not without regrets, for the leaf just
turned in their life histories had been an
interesting one. As they scanned the scenes
of the recent adventures they could hardly be
expected to realize that the stirring deeds of
the past few weeks formed but a milestone in
the career of one who served his country on
the seas.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
